2127. selenium toxicity in domestic animalsthe article, with an extensive bibliography, is a compendium of availableinformation on selenium toxicity in domestic animals.  literature revealsevidence of organically bound se being more biologically active, when givenorally to domestic animals, than inorganic se salts.  there is also variationin toxicity of organic se analogs.  when exposed to ruminal digestion, there isconsiderable reduction of se salts to the relatively biologically inactiveelemental se; which may result in fecal excretion of se, as such, to as muchas 40% of a single oral dose.  fluorine, molybdenum, chromium, vanadium,cadmium, zinc, cobalt, nickel and uranium increase se toxicity.  arsenic andtungsten give some protection against it.  bromobenzene, benzene, andnapthalenemobilize tissue se and stimulate its excretion.  since se preparations designedfor topical application in treatment of skin disease have been available forusein both man and dogs, the literature has reported cases of poisoning frommisuseof such preparations.  selenium, properly used, can be a valuable therapeuticagent, though certain salts of se must be regarded as potentially toxic.however, there is considerable latitude between therapeutic and/or nutritionaland toxic doses of these salts.

1577. mode of action of selenium in relation to biological activity oftocopherolsdietary selenium at levels below 1 ppm has a partially beneficial effectupon nutritional muscular dystrophy but is ineffective or detrimentalat higher levels.  the role of selenium in improving the effectiveness ofvitamin e is due at least in part to the fact that dietary selenium increasesthe retention of the a-tocopherols, especially d-a-tocopherol.  this has beenshown by chemical determination of plasma tocopherols and also by tracing theactivities of tritiated tocopherols and selenium75 in serum and in variousfractions of serum proteins in chicks receiving these nutrients alone and incombination.  se75 and h3-a-tocopherol activities followed each other veryclosely in the serum proteins.  these studies indicated that vitamin e may becarried by a selenolipoprotein fraction associated with serum y-globulin.  thus,one biological role of selenium appears to lie in a selenium-containingcompound which acts as a carrier of vitamin e and which may function inabsorption, retention, prevention of destruction, and perhaps transfer acrosscell membranes of d-a-tocopherol, thereby enhancing its biological activityin the blood and perhaps in cells throughout the body.

2701. the role of certain additional factors in the development of amyloidosis,and its prophylaxis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)in patients with chronic fibrocavernoustuberculosis of the lungs, any toxic-aller-gic side reactions to antibacterial therapy,chronic foci or infection and diseaseswith an allergic component can contributeto the development of amyloidosis.  theearly detection and clearing of chronicfoci of infection and effective measuresagainst even mildly pronounced toxic-allergicside reactions are of prime impor-tance in the prevention of amyloidosis.  theunsystematic and prolonged administra-tion of antibacterial preparations, along withtheir toxic side effects, tends to in-crease the incidence of amyloidosis in patientswith chronic fibrocavernous pulmon-ary tb.  individual constitutional factors areof great importance in the developmentof side effects.  side reactions to chemopreparations,in cases of hypofunction ofthe liver and kidneys and autonomicdysfunction promote the development of dys-trophic processes, as is confirmedby the high frequency of toxic-allergic reac-tions in patients with fibrocavernouspulmonary tb who later develop amyloidosis.the administration of desensitizing drugsto patients showing side reactions there-fore helps to prevent amyloidosis in casesof chronic fibrocavernous tb, and chemo-therapy should be automatically combinedwith the administration of desensitizingand stimulatory drugs in this class of case.

3083. myocardial toxicity of contrast agents used in angiographythe myocardial toxicity of many current andsome experimental contrast agentshas been studied in dogs, by use of a previouslyunreported method of occlusionretrograde coronary venography as well as thefamiliar technique of selectivecoronary arterial catheterization.  the followingconclusions appear justified inthe light of the experiments   not only theiodine-containing radicals with which thecontrast agents are so often identified (acetrizoates,diatrizoates, iothalamates,etc.), but also the final salification products appearto be responsible for the widelydivergent degrees of myocardial toxicity of contrastagents, to the point that differ-ent salts of the same compound behave as entirelydifferent agents both chemicallyand biologically.  the results seem to indicate thedominance of sodium ion and/orthe protective effect of methylglucamine salts withrespect to the myocardial toxi-city of current radiopaque media.  reported,yet unexplained, electrocardiographicchanges occurring within one to two secondsfrom the beginning of massive cavalhigh-pressure injections appear to find acausal relationship in the myocardial ir-ritability induced by the distention of thecoronary veins and the myocardial infiltra-tion which is intentionally enhanced withour retrograde injection techniques.  a pe-culiar trait, shared in varying degrees byall radiopaque agents tested, is theirability to increase coronary blood flow.the clinical significance of this phenome-non, however, remains to be established.these studies re-emphasize the limita-tions of the standard toxicity studies conductedin animals.  it should be clear fromthe results reported that agents to beadministered into the coronary circulationdemand investigation in regard to theirpotential toxicity by the methods describedherein or variations thereof.  in fact,similar tests should be carried out for all or-gans to be subjected to radiographicexamination via the vascular bed.  the authorshope that this presentation will stimulaterenewed investigation, particularly in viewof the growing clinical applications ofselective cardiovascular opacification tech-niques.

epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) as a therapeutic agent based on 5years clinical experience.experience in the treatment of 744 patients withe-aca suggested that the use of the preparation is indicatedin the following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhagein association with delivery.  (2) acute systemicfibrinolysis in association with surgery.  it ismainly major operations on the thorax, pancreas, prostate,liver and genital organs that are complicated byfibrinolysis, but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur afterany operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis in patientswith cancer, particularly cancer of the prostateand pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicatingvarious disorders, especially leukaemia, livercirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote inthrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activityin the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduceblood losses following prostatectomy, especially if thetreatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopicallyclear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumaticinjury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia andother coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effectivewhether given orally or intravenously.  in stateswith increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity inthe urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day hasproved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug one.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function testswere observed, not even in cases receiving more than1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs ofintravascular coagulation in connection with e-acatherapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications after prostatectomy in patientstreated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.judging from the authors' experience in this materiale-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.

198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note ofcautionazathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classifiedas 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects ofazathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because ofthe concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during theadministration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolongedsteroid therapy.  in 1 patient, the administration of azathioprine wasassociated with amelioration of an arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum which didnot respond to the use of steroids and other medication.  immuno-suppressiveobservations were limited.  the established delayed hypersensitivity response,as reflected in various skin tests, was unchanged during the administration ofazathioprine.  azathioprine had no discernible toxic effects upon the kidneysor the liver in 2 patients, 1 with postnecrotic cirrhosis and the other withserum hepatitis.  gastro-intestinal symptoms (anorexia, epigastric discomfort,and nausea) occurred in 8 patients.  mild to moderate leukopenia developed in 8patients and, in 2 individuals, was accompanied by thrombocytopenia.  temporaryalopecia occurred in 1 woman.  the hematopoietic effects developed within 2 or3 wk of therapy with azathioprine at a dosage level of 4-6 mg/kg/day.azathioprine does not exert the rapid beneficial effect in ulcerative colitisnoted with corticotropin and adrenal corticosteroids.  therefore, its use insevere ulcerative colitis requiring intensive therapy probably is undesirable.azathioprine, on the basis of these initial observations, may be considered formoderately severe ulcerative colitis, under circumstances permitting controlledand prolonged therapeutic trial as adjunct medication, but with carefulsupervision for prevention of toxicity, especially leukopenia.

nephrogenic diabetes insipiduschlorothiazide has been found of value inestablishing and maintaining adequate hydra-tion in some patients; its exact mechanism ofaction is not known.  the antidiuretic effectsof chlorothiazide and its analogues have beenstudied in six patients with ndi, two ofwhom were infants less than six months ofage.  dehydrated infants showed a dramaticresponse to treatment.  with those unable toachieve an optimal fluid intake prior to treat-ment, the initial beneficial response was asso-ciated with an increased fluid intake.  follow-ing this initial antidiuretic response, a vari-able degree of "escape" or resistance to theaction of the drug commonly occurred.  de-spite the unpredictability of a prolonged anti-diuretic response, a therapeutic trial of chloro-thiazide in ndi seems warranted if diet aloneis not sufficient to maintain hydration.  it mustbe remembered, however, that this drug is po-tentially toxic.

treatment of childhood schizophrenia.  a three-year comparison of dayand residential treatment.a carefully designed study of 13 day-treatmentchildren matched individually with 13 residential childrenis presented.  in each case the diagnosis of schizophreniawas carefully confirmed on the basis of impairmentin human relationship, disturbance in personalidentity, resistance to change, unusual preoccupations,perceptual and cognitive disorders, and panic reactions.the ages ranged between 6 and 11.  the children wereselected, as the result of matching, with regard to ageof onset, culture, and family organization.  intactnessof the family structure was required.  residential treatmentimplied round-the-clock therapeutic interactionwith the child for 7 days each week, 12 mth of the year.day treatment consisted of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. care5 days a week for 9 mth of the year.  staff distributionwas identical in the 2 groups, but in the day-care groupthe teacher assumed a larger relative position in theworld established for the child.  all children were matchedin ego status at the beginning of the experimentby means of the wisc and psychiatric evaluation,changes in this status being measured by the wisc andthe metropolitan achievement test series.  the resultsindicated no significant improvement in either day orresidence in those schizophrenic children who, on admissionhad unscorable wisc tests and who were themost severely impaired in ego structure.  among thechildren scorable on the wisc, the organic groups inday and in residential treatment showed equivalent degreesof progress, the non-organic children in residencegave evidence of more improvement than did thematched children in day treatment.

influence of hormones on tumor growth and plasma prolactin levels in ratsbearing a pituitary "mammotropic" tumorthe effects of estradiol, cortisol acetate, thyroxine, or thiouracil ontumor growth, organ weights, and plasma prolactin levels were determinedin rats bearing a furth pituitary "mammotropic" tumor (mtt.f4).  thistumor is known to secrete large amounts of adrenocorticotropin, somatotropin,and prolactin, but no follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone,or thyrotropin.  at the dose levels used, estradiol significantly suppressedtumor growth without influencing body growth, and it partially inhibitedenlargement of the adrenals and atrophy of the thymus.  cortisol acetatesignificantly reduced both tumor and body growth.  thyroxine had no significanteffect on tumor growth but enhanced the somatotropic effect as indicated byincreases in body growth and organ weights.  thiouracil had no significanteffect on tumor or body growth, although it significantly increased thyroidweight.  estradiol, cortisol acetate, and thyroxine each increased the plasmaprolactin levels of the tumor-bearing rats.

growth and growth retardationvarious attempts have been made over the years to define growth.  fromthe standpoint of this review, growth is the physiological accretion of newtissue which is reflected in the acquisition of protein and water.  thisprocess in almost all instances leads to increase in size (length, weight, andvolume) and actively progresses from the fertilization of the ovum to theperiod of sexual maturity where millions of cells are present in a state ofadvanced organization.  with further time, growth is less and, indeed, maybecome negative insofar as cells are lost.

3927. studies on growth and cytomorphosisin the thymo-lympha-tic systems - with specialreference to the influence ofthe thymus and the thyroidin guinea-pigsmigratory streams of lymphocytes betweendifferent parts of the thymo-lymphaticsystem were evaluated by comparisons betweenlymphocyte populations in thoracic-duct lymph and arterial and venous blood,especially thymic venous blood.  by re-cording organ weights in sham-operated andthymectomized guinea-pigs, treatedwith thyroxin or untreated, the importanceof the thymus and the thyroid for growthand regeneration in the thymo-lymphaticsystem was studied.  the main results areas follows.  there is a considerable venousoutput of lymphocytes with low mito-chondrial content (small lymphocytes) fromthe thymus in normal young guinea-pigs.this explains the much higher incidence ofsmall lymphocytes in blood than in tho-racic-duct lymph.  neonatal thymectomycauses lymphatic hypotrophy with defi-ciency of lymphocytes and pyroninophiliccells in relation to reticular ones.  bodygrowth and survival of the animals are notaffected.  in the thymus, exogenousthyroxin most probably promotes differentiationof large basophilic cells to smalllymphocytes, resulting in an increased output ofsmall lymphocytes.  in the lymphnodes, thyroxin promotes differentiation of largepyroninophilic cells ('transitionalcells') into immature and mature plasma cells.the effects of thyroxin on dif-ferentiation are followed by an increased growthof the thymo-lymphatic organs,characterized by an increased incidence of largebasophilic cells and increased weightof the lymphatic organs.  growth of the thymus andlymph nodes precedes that ofthe red splenic pulp.  this delayed splenic responseis not due to a transformationof an increased number of immigrated thymiclymphocytes, as neonatal thymectomydoes not prevent the thyroxin-stimulatedoccurrence of large basophilic cells in thered splenic pulp.  the thyroxin-stimulatedgrowth of the lymphatic system is ac-companied by an increased output of largerlymphocytes through the thoracicduct, resulting in an increased number oflarger lymphocytes in the blood.  inpostnatally thymectomized animals, having anormal (or above normal) amount ofcirculating small lymphocytes, thyroxin producesa drastic decrease in the number ofsmall blood lymphocytes, indicating a decreaseddelivery and/or increased disappear-ance of these cells to and from the blood, respectively.this decrease in number of smalllymphocytes is not seen in sham-operated animals.as judged by studies of organweights, the thyroxin-stimulated growth andregeneration of the lymphatic tissueare influenced antagonistically by thymectomyand synergistically by local factorsin involuted tissue.

the serological differentiation of mycoplasma strains (pleuro-pneumonia-like organisms) from various sourcesa complement fixation test with rabbit antisera was used to differentiate 82cultures of mycoplasma from man, mammalian cell cultures, laboratory rats andmice, cattle, goats, poultry, embryonated eggs and sewage.seventeen serotypes were distinguished, 5 from man, 1 from mammalian cellcultures, 4 from rats and mice, 4 from cattle and goats, 2 from poultry and onesaprophytic.  most of these corresponded to recognized species of mycoplasma,but 1 of human origin (represented by 1 strain, navel), and 1 from tissuecultures (5 strains), may represent new species.  r38, one of the serotypesfrom rats, could be distinguished from the species m. arthritidis, but isprobably an antigenic variant rather than a distinct species.  two specieshitherto recognized as distinct m. arthritidis and m. hominis type 2, could notbe distinguished and appear to constitute a single species.  these findingsillustrate the necessity, from the viewpoint of taxonomy, of comparingmycoplasma strains by serological methods.the serotypes of human and animal origin were largely host-specific.exceptions were the inclusion of m. arthritidis from rats and m. hominis type 2from man in a single serotype, the finding of a bovine organism among thestrains isolated from goats and of a saprophytic strain in a rat.in relation to the aetiology of disease in man and animals, the isolation ofan endogenous mycoplasma from embryonated eggs used to passage infectivematerial illustrates the importance of identifying these organismsserologically.  the demonstration of mixed mycoplasma infections in lesionsin two rats shows the necessity of adequately purifying all cultures ofmycoplasma before examination.

1688. surface phenomena in lungs in health and diseasein summary, the authors have attemptedto bring together the multiple observationswhich seem germane to the understandingof surface phenomena in lungs in healthand disease.  to this end, the contributionsof anatomists and pathologists on thefine structure of alveolar cells and theirlining are fundamental.  the concepts ofalveolar stability required the specialinsights of physiologists who were concernedwith the causes of bubble stability asthey related to the particular problems posedby a lung of several millions of bubblesarranged in parallel.  soon the contributionsof the chemists became significant asmethods of identification and assay of the al-veolar lining material were of interest.clinicians asked what relevance these studieshad to atelectasis as it occurs in disease,and soon the question of when the surfac-tant appeared in development occurred tothose concerned with premature infants.students of metabolism began to focus onthe lung as a site of phospholipid synthesis,and their tools seem most promising atthis time in unearthing possible errors inmetabolism which may express themselvesin disease.  surgeons who undertake per-fusion of the isolated lung ask therequirements of that organ with respect to thenutrients and environment of the alveolarcells, and anesthesiologists inquire intothe possibilities of mechanical injuryto the alveoli during artificial respiration.the problems posed to the reviewersof a subject which touches so many disciplinesare obvious.  doubtless some pertinentstudies have been omitted although uninten-tionally; others may have beenmisinterpreted through lack of qualifications as spe-cialists in all specialties.  theauthors hope they have provided evidence that theforces of surface tension cannotbe ignored in an organ with an air-liquid interfaceof some 70 m2.  they further hopethey have described some of the properties ofthe film at the alveolar-air interfacewhich operate to produce stability of the alveoli.they hold the belief that study of themetabolism of the alveolar lining layer willfurther their understanding of a numberof disease processes in which it may bealtered.  and lastly, they hope for muchcloser communication between workers inmany disciplines who can elucidate thisremarkable subject best through cooperativestudies.

twins discordantfor early infantile autisma pair of heterozygous twins discordantfor early infantile autism is reported and therelevant literature reviewed.  although mani-fest organic factors were ruled out, the twins'physical development was different.  a spe-cific emotional etiology was not demon-strated.  the few available twin studies offerfindings consistent with the hypothesis thatgenetic factors are relevant to the develop-ment of childhood autism.  evidence is alsopresented that impaired acquisition of lan-guage may have hereditary determinants.a second set of probably homozygoustwins are reported who were also discordantfor autism.  this second case suggests that,although genetic factors may play a part, insome cases the syndrome of infantile autismappears to be a reversible one.  in view ofthis set of twins and of kanner's sibling data,the role of genetic factors remains obscure,and more twin studies properly documentedwith blood typing are needed.

1388. optic agnosia  semeiological and pathogenetic aspectsthe authors discuss the classical concept of agnosia and make a survey ofpathogenetical factors which determine its phenomenology.  the original andtraditional concept of such a term implied the loss of the capacity torecognize objects, when the functions of sense organs are undamaged.  thepsychological studies on perception and the modern physiology ofvision allow to avoid the dichotomy between sensation and perception andto affirm their identity.  cortex and recptors are closely bound andfunction in unison.every cortical alteration is thus reflected in sensorial functions; it istherefore that on practical semeiological grounds it is possible to obtain acongruous information of the corresponding cortical functionality through anexploration of sense organs carried out by suitable means.  since we areconfronted with functional changes, exploration methods must be fit to evaluatedynamic aspects of perception in connection with the temporalization andspatialization of stimuli.  such methods are now quite numerous and oftencomplex  a particular stress is laid on local adaptation, flicker fusion, andtachistoscopy on account of their significance and suitability.  by suchmethods it is possible to show those functional deficits or pathologicaldisturbances of sensorial functions which are also behind the pathology ofvisual recognition.  fluctuation, extinction, alteration in the perception ofmovement, both real and apparent, changes in adaptation to light anddarkness are all phenomena which can be detected instrumentally and which,at the same time, may be of determinant importance for the onset of 'agnosic'behaviour.  the complexity of the latter, on the other hand, cannot alwaysbe explained by sensorial disturbances only  other mechanisms, with a functioncomplementary but not less indispensable to the dynamics of perceptiveprocesses, may intervene and interfere in it.  on the basis of the latestneurophysiological data the attention is called to ocular motility andproprioceptivity, centrifugal innervation of sensorial receptors, andvestibular afferences.  a particular clinico-pathogenetical significance isattached by the authors to the association of lateral visual disturbances withaltered proprioceptive and kinesthetic information from the correspondinghalf-body  such association in fact is nearly always present among the factorsresponsible for the most strictly 'spatial' errors of 'agnosic' pathology.  inthe light of these pathogenetical considerations as well as of suitablesemeiological findings, the authors deem it convenient to divide their casesinto 3 categories with distinct clinical features  (a) cases in which alteredvisual behaviour may be related to changes of the visual function and of itscomplementary mechanisms; (b) cases in which hemianopia is associated witha homolateral deficit of somatic proprioceptivity; (c) cases in which thechanges in behaviour are chiefly, but not only, due to a dissolutionof the symbolic sphere.

2469. the nature of collagen disease, particularly of systemic lupuserythematosus (sle), with special reference to renal lesions (japanese)from the results of examination of 161 autopsy cases of collagen diseases,rheumatic fever and polyarteritis nodosa (pn) are considered as diseases ofhyperergic nature, showing pronounced specific manifestation in particularorgans.  as the reactivity becomes lower, this specific localization becomesless significant and many organs become affected in sle.  it may accordingly besupposed that sle is not a disease of hypersensitivity but one occurring ina state of exhaustion of reactability after prolonged sensitization.  moreover,a sle-like syndrome arises not only in the end stage of parasepsis, nephritis,nephrosis and some cases of prolonged sensitization by myco.tb but also inpn,pss,dm and rheumatism.  it may therefore be conceivable that sle isa syndrome rather than a separate entity.  it is most important to considerwhether sle-like symptomatology may be regarded as a process equal toan auto-immunization and whether the key to morphological elucidation of theauto-immune phenomenon may lie hidden in this problem.

the autistic childthe conditions most frequently mistakenfor autism are speech disorder, brain damageand mental deficiency, each a prominentsymptom of the psychotic child.  careful his-tory and close observation to disclose symp-toms of withdrawal, lack of ego, compulsionfor sameness, and displays of intelligencegive incomplete clues to the diagnosis.the etiology of autism is uncertain.  sev-eral factors seem significant.  the importantrole of organic damage of the brain is under-scored by the coincidence of epilepsy, eegand neurological abnormalities in these chil-dren.  in our series seizures of various typesoccurred in 25%, eeg abnormalities in 58%,and minor neurological deficits in 70% ofthe cases.  environmental factors are quiteobviously important in many instances.  theemotional and behavioral pattern of the par-ents toward the infant is often incriminated.separation, inattention, coldness, rejection,etc. have been found in many situations.  fa-milial incidence of psychoses is low; so isthat of autism in siblings.

parathyroid extract-induced changes in the oxidation of citrate,succinate and other organic acids by liver.parathyroid extract (pte) or partiallypurified parathyroid hormone administered invivo markedly altered the oxidationin vitro by rabbit liver minces of citrate, -ketoglutarate-c, succinate-c, fumarate-cand lactate.  with ca ++ present in theincubation medium, minces from ptetreated animals produced more co and hada greater o consumption than did controlminces.  this stimulation was due, in partat least, to a more rapid decline in metabolicactivity of the control tissues.  whenca++ was absent, total metabolism wasincreased and the tissue derived from ptetreated animals was less active than thecontrol tissue.  the effect was detected asearly as 4 hr after injection (750 u/kg)and could be elicited with as little as 200 u(at 14 hr).  the action of pte could notbe duplicated by the injection of cacl intothe animal.  the data suggest that one effectof treatment was a general inhibition ofoxidation.  the stimulation of metabolismcould be a consequence of this inhibitionor a separate unrelated alteration.

2803. effect of dosage on endotoxin-induced changes in the reticuloendothelialsystem of rabbitstissues were removed from rabbits 4and 24 hr. following an i.v. injection of 5,25, or 200 ug of endotoxin.  explants oftissues from normal and injected animalswere grown in a coagulated plasma mediumand in medium containing 1 ug/ml ofendotoxin.  the migration and growth of cellswere observed during the following weekof incubation.  the inhibition or stimulationof cells of the reticuloendothelial system(res) at different host sites after endotoxinadministration depended on the dosageand on the known capacity of different organsto take up circulating endotoxin.  macro-phage migration was suppressed in culturesof spleen removed 4 hr. after a dose ofhibited by 200 ug, but macrophages inlymph node, testis, and thymus showed an in-crease in numbers, in extent of migrationand in phagocytic activity.  widespreadres stimulation was seen in tissues removed24 hr after the largest dose.  in ad-dition to the restoration of re cell activity inspleen and lung there was a markedincrease in the migration of large phagocyticcells from bone marrow, as well asother organs.  macrophages from endotoxin-injectedanimals were as sensitive asnormal macrophages to added endotoxin in vitro.

1835. the decrease of the steroids in the urine in the course of lung tb.(the therapeutic value of their increase after calciferol)quantitative determination of the urinarysteroids in 38 patients with extensive ul-cero-caseous pulmonary tb confirmedthat the 17-ketosteroids are always decreasedin these cases.  calciferol, in the formof one ampoule of vit.  d2 of 600,000 u.every 10 days, in combination with activetuberculostatic drugs, in the majority ofthe cases leads to an increase of theurinary 17-ketosteroids from 50 to 100% in 2mth.  it appears that the calciferolexerts its action through proteolysis; it stimulatesthe liquefaction and evacuation of thecaseous material.  this proteolytic effect isrelated to that of the mineralocorticoids,which are phlogistic and proteolytic sub-stances.  calciferol offers the advantageover these substances that it does not affectthe electrolytes and is well tolerated bythe organism.  for this reason, good resultsmay be expected from its administrationin cases of extensive pulmonary tb, inwhich the myc. tuberculosis has remainedsensitive to the administered tuberculosticdrugs but nevertheless does not proceedtowards recovery because of the marked caseouslesions.  in such cases calciferol treatmentleads to a rapid and pronounced decreaseof the radiological shadows, improves thegeneral condition and also modifies thesteroid metabolism rendered abnormal by the disease.

clinical features of the alalies (russian).the term 'alalies' is applied to the variousstates of absence or insufficient developmentof speech in children, resultingfrom defective development or affectionsof the speech centers before the developmentof speech.  from the clinicalstudy it is possible to distinguish between severalforms: motor, sensory, andsemantic alaly with signs of amnesia.  thecauses are multiple: trauma, perinatalcerebral hemorrhage, inflammatory processes,metabolic disorders before thedevelopment of speech, and alimentary andtrophic disorders.  the alalies showvarying degrees of severity.  in most childrensuffering from alaly, neurologicalsigns can be demonstrated on the right side,an indication of the organic nature ofthe condition.  the presence of local symptomsin the various forms of alaly isoften associated with signs indicating involvementof adjacent regions of the cerebralhemispheres in the pathological processwhich would explain why the alaliesare often complex.  the character of the alaliesdepends on functional disordersresulting from the lesion in the frontal, anterior,motor, temporal or parietalregion of the dominant cerebral hemisphere.patients with alaly often show neuroticreactions, resulting from the disordersof the processes of inhibition and excitationof the cerebral cortex and the subcorticalformations.  early treatment ofthe alalies with drugs combined with logopedicand pedagogic measures gives good results.

studies in perfusion hypothermia with special reference to /deephypothermia/ and circulatory arrest .1. perfusion hypothermia produces large temperature gradients withinthe body since organs are cooled roughly in proportion to their basalblood flows . the difference between the coldest and the warmest portionof the body after 30 minutes of perfusion exceeds 25 c .2. the average body temperature, which provides a proper measure oftotal body cooling, may be calculated from the arteriovenous temperaturedifference and the extracorporeal flow rate .3. true /deep/ hypothermia is not obtainable by reasonable periods ofperfusion alone .4. an important rise of core temperatures occurs during circulatoryarrest in hypothermia because of relatively high average bodytemperature .5. high average body temperatures lead to continuing production oflactic acid in muscle tissue, whereas low core temperatures impairlactic acid metabolism . thus metabolic acidosis is progressive inprolonged perfusion hypothermia, and is accentuated by total circulatoryarrest . progressive acidosis may be minimized by uniform profoundcooling by combining external with perfusion hypothermia .6 diluents appear to have little effect on total body heat exchangeduring perfusion cooling .7. perfusion warming has a differentially greater effect on coreorgans . though these are readily brought to a normal range, much of theanimal may remain cold .

(1) there is an elevation of total serum lipid,phospholipid, triglyceride, free fatty acid and cholesterol,. (2) whilethe total lipid of the liver and kidney are increased, that of the depotfat is decreased,. (3) palmitate and oleate are increased in serum andliver,. (4) arachidonate and stearate are decreased in serum and liver,.and (5) placentas contain more stearate than the other organs of thepregnant rat and also have a higher water content . the decrease indepot total fat,. elevation of serum, liver and kidney total fat,. andelevation of serum free fatty acids suggest that pregnancy inducedmobilization of depot fat . the increase in proportion of liver andserum palmitate suggests that pregnancy induces increased lipogenesisfrom the acetate pool . the appearance of an increased amount oflong-chain fatty acids in the liver may be due to the increased intakeof dietary fat . the decrease in arachidonate and stearate in serum andliver suggests a relative decrease in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis

1163. the effect of glucose infusions on the lipoid and thecarbohydrate metabolism of the parturient woman andthe fetusin 20 parturient women who were given glucoseinfusions during the expulsive stageof labor, the authors were able to observe an unusualhyperglycemia and a decreasein unesterified fatty acids (uefa).  the uefa-levelusually increases regularlyduring delivery.  likewise, the values of esterifiedfatty acids (efa) showed an in-crease above the normally present levels in womenwho had received a glucose in-fusion during the expulsive stage of labor.  theresults show that during deliveryboth hyperglycemia and the increase in lipoidsare predominantly due to the energydemands of the organism.  however, there is alsoevidence that other, hitherto un-known factors may play a role.  in the fetus,the infusion of glucose leads to an in-creased glucose retention.  the infusion, however,does not bring about a decrease,but, contrary to the expectations, an increasein the uefa-values.  in general,such a reaction is not found in any of thesubsequent periods of life.  further inves-tigations were conducted in order to find anexplanation for the paradox uefa-reaction.  as shown by an analysis of the lacticacid and the pyruvic acid values, theincrease in the uefa can most probably not beattributed to an impairment in thefetal metabolic conditions.  the administrationof physiological saline infusions to10 parturient women under equal conditionsrevealed that the cause for the uefa-increase can apparently neither be found inhemodynamic changes due to the infusionnor in changes of the electrolyte balance, butrather in an adaptation insufficiencyof the fetal islet cells, respectively in a differentfat mobilization or fat deposition.

isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from adults with respiratoryinfections.isolation of mycoplasma organisms from the sputumwas attempted in 254 patients with various syndromeof respiratory disease.  isolates were obtained in 56% ofthe 197 patients with pneumonia, 50% of patients withchronic bronchial diseases who were not treated withtetracycline, and 33% of persons with acute upper respiratoryinfection.  these differences are not statisticallysignificant and indicate a nonpathogenic role for m.pharyngis and m. salivarium which were the strains mostfrequently isolated.  the highest frequency of isolationwas from males 15 to 30 yr. of age.  isolation of m.pneumoniae requires one to 2 weeks:therefore, it is notuseful for rapid diagnosis.  also, it underestimates theprevalence of infection, especially if patients have receivedtetracycline.  of the serologic tests, complement-fixation(cf) was the most specific.  the growthinhibition test (tri) was the most sensitive and wassignificantly related to atypical pneumonia.  the 2 testsmay measure different antibodies against m. pneumoniae.serum cold agglutinins developed in many casesof pneumonia and were poorly discriminatory in etiologicdiagnosis.  m. pneumoniae infection occurred in aminimum of 8% and a maximum of 20% of civilian patientshospitalized for pneumonia during the season studied.serologic evidence for m. pneumoniae was rare inlobar pneumonia.  in nonlobar pneumonia, m. pneumoniaeaccounted etiologically for 13% to 50% of cases.  the incidenceof m. pneumoniae infection was constant indifferent seasons but greatest relative to the occurrenceof pneumonia in the fall and spring.

the influence of organic and emotional factors on the origins, natureand outcome of childhood psychosis.a group of 65 children diagnosed as 'childpsychosis' (or one of its synonyms)was followed up for an average of 15 yr.none of the parents were schizophrenic;6 (10%) had a parent who had psychiatrictreatment for neurosis.  only 2 childrenhad a sib with transient autistic episode.none had sibs with the adult type ofschizophrenia.  these findings are felt tomilitate against the view that childpsychosis is part of the schizophrenic group.among the 65 children: 40% had ani.q. below 50, 40% between 50 and 80 andonly 20% above 80.  the i.q. was foundin general to be a good predictor of laterperformances.  mental retardation isregarded as a primary component of theclinical picture.  evidence of brain damagewas conclusive in 15 children (24%) who showedepileptic attacks (developing in 10of them during the follow-up).  speech disorderswere the most outstanding manifestation.five children had confirmed receptiveaphasia and 14 others show someevidence of it.  in 75% of the speaking childrenecholalia was noted; 11% had abnormalitiesof delivering spoken words.  theview that reduction of speech is dueto social withdrawal is rejected.  psychogenicfactors and parental attitude werenot found to be relevant to the etiology.  thepsychosis is not considered primarilyemotional in origin, although emotionalrelationships as well as educational managementhave considerable influence on theoutcome of the disease.

implications of gerstmann's syndrome .of 465 consecutive patients subjected to a standardized battery ofneuropsychological tests, 111 had one or more components of gerstmann'ssyndrome . each of these 111 patients had some evidence of organic braindysfunction in addition to gerstmann components . as the number ofgerstmann components increased, the responsible brain lesions tended tobe larger, more highly destructive of tissue, and to cause greaterneurological impairment . every patient with four gerstmann componentshad associated evidence of severe impairment of brain functions and thelesion or underlying disease was likely to compromise survival of thepatient . the syndrome is not to be regarded as an autonomous entity,but merges with numerous other neurological deficits, notably dysphasiain agreement with benton, we find no justification for singling outthe four gerstmann components as a separate syndrome, unless one is alsoprepared to recognize that any other arbitrary groups of concurrentdeficits are also separate syndromes .in at least three of 23 patients with all four gerstmann components,the angular gyrus, as shown by necropsy examination, was not involved bythe lesion . however, the probability that the left hemisphere containeda lesion increased with the number of gerstmann components, and theprobability of involvement of the left posterior parasylvian area alsoincreased with the increase in the number of gerstmann components . withtwo, three, or four gerstmann components, the lesions were neverrestricted to the angular gyrus but tended to spread widely over theparietal, temporal, and occipital lobes . as to localizing significance,gerstmann's syndrome has approximately the same degree of cogency asdysphasia .

studies on eperythrozoon infection in sheepthe intravenous inoculation of blood from sheep in the parasi-taemic stage of eperythrozoon infection produced detectableparasitaemia in recipient sheep within 7 days.  the parasitaemialasted from 3 to 12 weeks and was accompanied by anaemia andoccasionally by icterus.  no other symptoms developed and in acontrolled experiment on hoggs there was no significant differencein weight gain between infected and control animals.a concurrent attack of tick-borne fever led to the disappearanceof eperythrozoon from the circulating blood.  it is suggested that thisphenomenon may be caused by the pyrexia.the incubation period following the inoculation of infected bloodin ten 3 to 4 week old lambs varied from 3 to 6 weeks.  in eight ofthese animals the symptoms were less severe than in adult sheep, butthe two smallest lambs developed a profound anaemia and failed togain weight.culture of the organism on sheep blood agar or on sheep kidneymonolayers was unsuccessful as was the attempted transmission ofthe infection to mice.the transference of keds and lice from infected to uninfectedsheep failed to transmit the infection, but a sheep was infected by theintravenous inoculation of ground-up lice from an infected animal.the only characteristic histopathological changes in infectedsheep were lymphoid hyperplasia of the malphigian corpuscles in thespleen and deposition of haemosiderin in the cells of the proximalconvoluted tubules in the kidney cortex.

influence of parathyroid activity on ionexchange in various tissues1. balance data from three patients with hypoparathyroidism, who weregiven parathyroid extract, are presented.  the metabolic response wascomplex.  the data demonstrate losses of phosphate, magnesium, sodiumand potassium which were not accounted for by destruction of either boneor non-osseous tissues.  preferential depletion of these minerals from bone,or loss from non-osseous tissues, must be presumed.2. the exchange of ca45, mg28, and p32 in a spectrum of rat tissues hasbeen studied in sham operated, parathyroidectomized, and parathyroidextract treated rats.  the effects of parathyroidectomy on the developmentof magnesium deficiency were determined.3. four hours after parathyroidectomy, increased transport of calciuminto bone, kidney, intestine, liver, brain, and muscle was found.  six daysafter parathyroidectomy equilibrium had been reestablished and exchangerates were identical to those in sham operated animals.4. the administration of parathyroid extract was associated with de-creased transport of ca15, mg28, and p32 into bone.  ca15 exchange in kidneywas reduced but in all other tissues exchange of ca15 and mg28 was in-creased.  p32 exchange in both intestine and kidney was mardedly increasedin animals receiving the extract.5. parathyroidectomy greatly minimized the manifestations of mag-nesium deficiency in young rats on magnesium deficient diets.6. the results suggest that parathyroid hormone may affect the trans-port and exchange of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate (and perhapssodium and potassium) in tissues other than those usually considered tobe target organs.

eeg abnormalities in early childhood schizophrenia:a double-blind study of psychiatrically distrubedand normal children during promazine sedationeeg tracings during promazine sedationwere obtained on 58 children who hadautistic or symbiotic childhood psychosis.for comparison eeg's were done underidentical conditions on 4 other groups ofchildren: 44 with chronic undifferentiatedschizophrenia; 37 non-psychotic childrenwith severe, acting-out behavior disorders;10 with neuroses; and 13 psychiatricallynormal children.  final clinical diagnoseswere made without knowledge of the eegreadings as determined for this study, andthe eeg's were all placed in random orderand read without any knowledge of theclinical diagnosis.  eeg abnormalities ac-cepted were focal slowing, focal spikes,paroxysmal spikes and waves, and par-oxysmal spikes and waves with independentspikes.among the 149 patients 51% had abnormalrecords.  none of the psychiatrically normalchildren had eeg abnormalities.  exceptfor the neurotics, the eeg abnormalitieswere qualitatively and quantitatively sim-ilar in the psychiatric patients.  themost frequent abnormalities were ir-regular paroxysmal spike and wave com-plexes, often best seen during thetransition from wake to sleep.  of the 149patients, 33% had this complex, either aloneor with independent spikes.  although thesecomplexes were most frequent in the au-tistic-symbiotic group, the incidence wasnot statistically significantly different fromthe higher performing, chronic undiffer-entiated schizophrenics who had communi-cative speech or the non-psychotic childrenwith acting-out behavior disorders.of the 58 autistic-symbiotic children, 19%had seizures, which is similar to the 13%seizure incidence in the remaining 91 psy-chiatric patients.whether the cerebral dysfunction im-plied by this study is a primary disorderor is secondary to some factor such as theeffect of prolonged anxiety on body chem-istry cannot be decided at this time.  never-theless, an organic concomitant has beendemonstrated in 51% of the psychiatricallydisturbed children.  by increasing theamount of time included in the eeg sam-ple, the incidence of electrical abnormalitiesmight be even higher.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero andin vitro with rubella virus.a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomeswas undertaken to determine if damageto the genetic apparatus of human cells maybe induced by rubella virus and whethersuch damage produces the pathology seenin newborns from mothers infected earlyin pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains wereinitiated in vitro from embryonic materialobtained by therapeutic abortion of fetusesfrom rubella-infected mothers.  embryonicmaterial from spontaneous and non-rubellatherapeutic abortions yielded similarcell strains for infection in vitro.  theresults from both types of studies were asfollows: (a) virus shedding cell strains wereobtained from all types of organs cultivated,which indicated wide disseminationof virus in the fetuses from rubella-infectedmothers.  (b) chronic infection couldreadily be established by in vitro infectionand no cytopathic effect was noted.(c) although many strains continued to shedvirus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,no changes in growth propertiesoccurred with the exception that infectedstrains from lung tissue showed limitedgrowth capacities.  (d) from observationsof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obviouschromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctionalchanges were observed instrains infected naturally or experimentally.(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derivedcell strains there was a marked elevationin frequency of chromosome breakage in3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlationbetween virus shedding in vitro andincreased chromosome breakage was notedalthough this was not complete.  (g) thecombined average frequency of chromosomebreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortionstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortusstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,but significant elevation in average chromosomebreak frequency (9.8%) was obtainedin four cell strains which had been experimentallyinfected in vitro with rubella virus(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effectsupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,these were restricted to slight general elevationsin frequency of breakage abovenormal values.  very high increases in breakswere sporadic.  it appears more likelythat the general fetal abnormalities associatedwith rubella infection in vivo resultfrom possible effects of the virus upon growthrather than from effects upon thechromosomes.  however, the studies wererestricted to fibroblasts cultured invitro; and effects on other types of cellsmay have greater implications for thisquestion.
