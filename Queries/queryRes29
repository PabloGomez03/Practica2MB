albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.  report of a family with studiesof bone remodeling.two members of a single family, each representingdifferent forms of albright's hereditary osteodystrophy,have been presented.  the kindred pattern issimilar to those of other reported families and is consistentwith a sex-linked or autosomal dominant mode ofinheritance.  the importance of a course of intramuscularparathyroid extract for proof of parathyroid hormoneresistance is emphasized.  biopsy specimens of rib,labeled in vivo with tetracycline, were studied microscopically.these new observations indicated cellulardefects in bone remodeling shared by the propositus andcase 2, which may explain the low rates of bone turnoverfound in each.  immunologic studies established thepresence of a substance antigenically similar to parathyroidhormone in the parathyroid tissue of the propositus.the pathogenesis of albright's hereditary osteodystrophyand atypical forms of parathyroid hormoneresistant hypocalcemia is discussed.

a genetic study of neonatal obstructive jaundice58 children with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 7 with intrahepaticbiliary atresia and 50 with 'neonatal hepatitis' were analysedconcerning diagnostic criteria, natural history, familial, clinicaland pathological data.  in extrahepatic biliary atresia, there is noevidence of a familial tendency, influence of maternal age, birthorder or disturbance of foetal development.  in 'neonatal hepatitis',there were 4 consanguineous parents, suggesting a mutantautosomal gene in homozygous form.  some infants with the genotypefor 'neonatal hepatitis' may manifest a very mild or a very severeform, so, a diagnosis was not made.  an apparent excess of malesover females may be another evidence of failure of manifestation ofthe genotype.  but 'neonatal hepatitis' may be a manifestation ofmore than one disease.  in 'neonatal hepatitis' the birth weightshows a marked decrease, perhaps as a sequence of disturbed liverfunction in the foetus.

neonatal hepatitis or familial neonatal obstructive jaundice?.four siblings all of whom were boys withchronic obstructive jaundice are described.the onset of the jaundice varied from 1 dayto 4 weeks after birth.  two other boysand 2 girls in the same family are healthy.although in one of the 4 cases pathologicalfindings were the same as in neonatal hepatitis('giant cell hepatitis'), other possibilitiescould not be excluded.  what has beendescribed hitherto as giant cell hepatitisappears to be only a morphological picture,for which there must be several causes.it is concluded from the findings in the 4 patientsthat one of the possible causes ofso-called giant cell hepatitis is an inbornerror of metabolism.

the importance of steroid hormones in hyperbilirubinemia, and icterusof the newborn.administration of naturally occurring steroids(estriol, pregnanediol, cortisone)between the 7th and the 11th day of life increasesthe bilirubin level of these newborns.administration of the same steroidsor of progesterone to nursing mothersresults in hyperbilirubinemia of their infants.these facts explain the pathogenesisof neonatal jaundice.  interpretation of theexperimental and clinical findings leadsto the conclusion that the high amount ofsteroid hormones which must be excretedduring the neonatal period in conjunctionwith the relative insufficiency of the neonatalliver is responsible for the inabilityto conjugate bilirubin with glucuronic acid.the steroid hormones probably competewith bilirubin for the enzyme and substratenecessary for conjugation.  the functionalcapacity of the neonatal liver isnot high enough to conjugate both bilirubinand steroids.  only after excretion of theplacental steroids does sufficient conjugationof bilirubin become possible.  furthermore,pregnanediol appears to inhibit theenzyme glucuronyl transferase.  thesemechanisms show the importance of steroidhormones in the pathogenesis of neonataljaundice and their importance as anaggravating factor in the development ofjaundice due to erythroblastosis.  these newlydeveloped concepts may have therapeuticimplications on which the author willreport at a later date.

lesions of the liver in hereditarymetabolic diseaseswhether the various cells of the liver, both parenchymal and stromal,receive genetic misinformation in all hereditary diseases caused by genemutation is unknown, but the metabolic capabilities of these several celltypes are so diverse that it is not surprising that their involvement inmany such diseases can be demonstrated by clinical, pathological, or bio-chemical methods.  repetitive abnormality of the liver has apparently notbeen defined for any disease caused by quantitative (i.e., chromosomal)gene anomaly, whether produced by nondisjunction, translocation, ormajor deletion, perhaps because relatively few such diseases have beendescribed.  as a result, the genetically determined disorders of the liversurveyed in this paper appear to be the result of conventional "singlegene" abnormalities, and to be transmitted in affected families by men-delian mechanisms.

neonatal hepatitis: liver biopsy findings and clinical features.on 22 infants with a clinical diagnosis of neonatalhepatitis, histologic examinationof the liver was made by needle biopsy andits relation to the clinical course wasinvestigated.  histologic findings were classifiedprovisionally into 3 types: type ishowed no giant cells but only slight damageto hepatic cells with prominent intracellularcholestasis; type ii was characterizedby occurrence of numerous giantcells; the specific type was characterized bycentrolobular cholestasis without inflammatoryreaction.  laboratory examinationsrevealed that increases in serumtransaminases and bilirubin were greater intype ii than in type i, and in the specifictype there was no increase in serum transaminasebut there was a direct hyperbilirubinemia.as to histologic sequelae,the results of serial biopsy revealed thatin type i hepatic damage healed almost completely,and that in type ii giant cellsdisappeared within 1 yr and, in some cases,hepatic cirrhosis resulted.  the prognosisof neonatal hepatitis may be said tobe good in type i, poor in type ii, andundetermined in the specific type.

neuroaxonal dystrophy in congenitalbiliary atresianeuroaxonal dystrophy has been described in 8 patients with congenitalbiliary atresia.  the characteristic changes include axonal dystrophy, a mildloss of nerve cells and a variable degree of astrocytic reaction, mainly in thegracile, cuneate and trigeminal nerve nuclei in the medulla, and rarely inother parts of the central nervous system.the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is remarkably similar to thatin patients with prolonged mucoviscidosis and in experimental vitamine-deficient rats.it is strongly suggested that the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patientswith congenital biliary atresia is a manifestation of prolonged vitamin edeficiency.the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is also similar to that seenin aging and bears resemblance to the axonal change encountered in a groupof heredo-degenerative diseases, the various forms of "hallervorden-spatzdisease".  the pathological similarity between these diverse conditionswarrants further investigation as to the possible metabolicrelationship between them.

2469. the nature of collagen disease, particularly of systemic lupuserythematosus (sle), with special reference to renal lesions (japanese)from the results of examination of 161 autopsy cases of collagen diseases,rheumatic fever and polyarteritis nodosa (pn) are considered as diseases ofhyperergic nature, showing pronounced specific manifestation in particularorgans.  as the reactivity becomes lower, this specific localization becomesless significant and many organs become affected in sle.  it may accordingly besupposed that sle is not a disease of hypersensitivity but one occurring ina state of exhaustion of reactability after prolonged sensitization.  moreover,a sle-like syndrome arises not only in the end stage of parasepsis, nephritis,nephrosis and some cases of prolonged sensitization by myco.tb but also inpn,pss,dm and rheumatism.  it may therefore be conceivable that sle isa syndrome rather than a separate entity.  it is most important to considerwhether sle-like symptomatology may be regarded as a process equal toan auto-immunization and whether the key to morphological elucidation of theauto-immune phenomenon may lie hidden in this problem.

fetal and neonatal hepatitis and its consequences.the author reports on 18 fatal cases observedin infants from 3 weeks to 1 year old.in all cases, jaundice appeared just after birthor during the first days of life, andwas persistent.  the stools were sometimesdiscolored.  there was no blood incompatibility.the picture was similar to thatof congenital biliary atresia.  pathologicalstudy revealed 2 groups: (1) with pathologicalchanges of hepatitis (11 cases).the liver is enlarged, flabby and icteric.  microscopyshows dissociation of the cellcords and polymorphism of the hepatic cells(necrotic cells, balloon cells, giant celltransformation).  some of the giant cells showvacuoles, erythrocytes, lipids andacidophilic material in their cytoplasm.  thereare signs of regeneration, collapseof the stromal framework, proliferation of themesenchymal cells and bile retention.cells of the erythrocytic series are scatteredin the periportal spaces with eosinophilicleucocytes, lymphocytes and histiocytes.(2) with fibrosis and cirrhosis (7cases).  the liver is green, firm, with a nodularor granular surface.  the extra-hepaticbiliary tree is normal.  the spleen isenlarged.  microscopy shows bile stasis,pericholangiolitic fibrosis, and proliferationof bile ductules.  the periportal, interlobularand intralobular fibrous tissue is increased,and shows cellular infiltrations.the architecture of the liver is disturbed bythe presence of pseudolobuli in the regenerationareas.  it is suggested that these casesare due to a congenital viral hepatitis,which is not only the result of an intrauterineinfection, but also a feature offetal hepatitis, with secondary pericholangioliticor post-necrotic liver cirrhosis.the neonatal giant cell hepatitis is to be consideredas the result of a cytotoxic actionof the virus.  the author considers alsothe possibility of a viral etiology incases of biliary atresia on the basis of theirmorphological similarity with congenitalviral hepatitis.

hypophysectomy, replacement therapy, and the tolerance of theeuryhaline killifish, fundulus heteroclitus, to hypotonic mediahypophysectomized fundulus heteroclitus, as previously reported, survive only afew days after transfer from salt to fresh water.  survival time is the samewhen fish are tested 2 weeks or 2 months after hypophysectomy.  gradualdilution of the external medium produces failure at an average salinity of0.26% (0.67-0.02%).  this salinity is comparable to that causing failure afterabrupt transfer.  although failure is associated with hypochloremia, dailyinjections of a balanced salt solution or 0.6% nacl shorten survival.daily injections of teleostean neurohypophysial peptides, arginine vasotocin(2.25 and 0.0225 pressor mu per gram) and isotocin (1.32 and 0.026 oxytocic muper gram) do not prolong survival.  an extract of caudal neurosecretory tissue(urophysis) from male tilapia mossambica had no beneficial action at doses of50 ug per gram every other day.  purified ovine prolactin.  105 mu per gram onalternate days, maintained survival of 10 of 11 fish for the duration of the28-day test period in fresh water, irrespective of the period of pretreatmentin salt water.  purified bovine prolactin prolonged survival and 2 of 6 fishwere maintained for 28 days.  purified bovine growth hormone was ineffective.monkey growth hormone containing 2 u per milligram of prolactin activity,administered at a dose of 20 ug per gram (equivalent to 40 mu per gramprolactin activity), prolonged survival.  human growth hormone containing 4 uper milligram of prolactin activity, at a dose of 20 ug per gram (equivalent to80 ml per gram prolactin activity) also prolonged survival and 4 of 6 fishwere maintained for 28 days.the ability of pituitary preparations to protect hypophysectomizedf. heteroclitus from failure in fresh water appears to be related to theirprolactin activity and not to their content of neurohypophysial peptides.this suggests that an adenohypophysial hormone resembling mammalian prolactinis essential for survival of this fish in hypotonic external media.  carppituitary preparations do not protect hypophysectomized f. heteroclitusalthough f. heteroclitus pituitaries are known to be effective.

3446. effect of nicl2 on an isolated ranvier nodean attempt was made to explain the extreme prolongation of the nodalpotential by 0.1-1.0 mm nicl2 in terms of the ionic theory.  the effects ofnicl2 at room temperature are similar to those of temperature reductiondecreased maximum rate of rise of the action potential, lengthened actionpotential duration, elevated threshold, increased tendency for repetitiveactivity; in addition, the amplitude of the action potential is slightlyincreased.  the long-lasting plateaus of the responses obtained under thecombined influence of nicl2 and temperature reduction are shortened by cathodalpolarization, strong anodal polarization and decrease of (na)0.  the plateaucan be prematurely terminated by short anodal pulses of critical amplitude;short cathodal pulses reduce the duration of the plateau gradually withincreasing pulse strength.  increased (k)0 prolongs plateau duration; thesteep repolarization phase which normally terminates the plateau isreplaced by a long lasting after-depolarization with stepwise potentialdecline.the amplitude of k-depolarization is not influenced by nicl2 or temperaturereduction.  1.0 mm nicl2 changes the relation between maximum rate ofrise and steady-state polarization; the potential change required for 50%sodium inactivation is +8mv in normal ringer's solution and +16mv in thepresence of 1.0 mm nicl2 (22 c.).  1.0 mm nicl2 increases the time constantof delayed rectification as measured in na-poor solutions at 4 c. by a factorof about 2.  the decrease of action potential under cathodal polarization isslightly delayed by nicl2.  it is concluded that prolongation of the nodalaction potential by nicl2 is due to delayed and reduced inactivation of napermeability and delayed increase of k permeability; part of the nicl2-effectcould be explained by assuming competition between ni++ and ca++ for specificsites at the membrane.

the immunological development of the humanfetusthe normal human fetus is said not to be engaged in the formation of immuno-globulins; the immunoglobulins present in the serum of the fetus and thenewborn are considered to be of maternal origin.  in favor of this opinion isthe observation that directly after birth the serum of the newborn contains anappreciable amount of igg, with gm groups identical with those of the mother(68-70).  the level of the igg of the neonate decreases gradually during thefirst 3 months (3,27,71), which is generally explained by the catabolism ofthe maternal igg, whereas the formation by the newborn infant is stillinadequate to maintain the original level (16,27).  the best evidence for thetransplacental passage is the almost complete absence of igg in the serum ofnewborn infants from mothers with agammaglobulinemia (3,27).the transfer of the immunoglobulins appears to be a selective process(13, 15).  while igg is readily transferred, there is little, if any,transfer of iga and igm, as has been shown by ultracentrifugation andimmunoelectrophoretic studies of the serum (12, 16, 19, 20) and the analysisof maternally-transferred antibodies (31-33).  with more sensitive techniquessuch as the double diffusion test in agar or quantitative immunochemicaltechniques, however, minute amounts of both igm and iga have been detectedin fetal blood as well as in cord blood from mature and immature neonates(12, 19, 20, 23, 26).  since large molecules do not pass the placenta, thismay indicate that the trace amounts of igm originate in the fetus itself, buttransplacental passage has not been completely excluded.the absence of immunoglobulin formation has been associated with the absenceof plasma cells in the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow of the normal humanfetus and the newborn.  it has been reported that these cells do not appearuntil a few weeks after birth (2, 3, 14, 25, 34).  however, in pathologicalconditions such as congenital syphilis and toxoplasmosis the human fetus hasbeen found to respond to the antigenic stimulus with intrauterine formation ofplasma cells after about the sixth month of gestation (24,25).

drugs and neonatal jaundice .this paper is not intended as an exhaustive review of bilirubinmetabolism nor of the many factors which may result in exaggeratedphysiologic jaundice.. for such a review the interested reader isreferred to the excellent articles by zuelzer and brown . brief mentionhas been made of the mechanism by which certain drugs may contribute tothe development of hyperbilirubinemia . a few drugs, the water-solublevitamin k derivatives, sulfasoxazole (gantrisin), the salicylates, andnovobiocin have been unequivocally shown to affect adversely the newborninfant's ability to handle bilirubin . in time other compounds willdefinitely be incriminated .it is important to remember that the administration of a drug to amother just prior to delivery may result in appreciable concentrationsof the compound in the infant's serum, and that drugs administered tothe nursing mother may be excreted in breast milk and thereby absorbedby the infant . careful consideration of the drugs given not only to thenewborn but also to the mother is therefore essential if we are to avoidwhat may be termed iatrogenic hyperbilirubinemia .

psychology of children's dental treatment .the communication deals with influences involved in the development ofthe child's attitude to dental treatment . they are extrinsic(educational etc.) and intrinsic (constitutional and hereditary) . theirunderstanding helps to determine the correct psychological policy forthe management of the child in the surgery .the aim of psychology applied in dentistry is to discover a mode oftreatment procedure which would ensure that the child will not besubject to any psychic traumatization (psychophylaxis) . its second aimis the management of the so called difficult child and his treatment .to understand better the child's frame of mind during dental treatmentthe situation in the surgery is dealt with step by step as the childexperiences it through his senses and his psyche . beside the basicsenses -dash hearing and seeing -dash others are also affected.. touch(pressure sensation), smell and taste .children during dental treatment are nearly always in a state ofraised emotional tension and are susceptible to anxiety reactions .according to the degree of fear which they manifest children may beclassed into categories of cooperating and difficult patients . thepsychological procedure for the treatment of children of both groups isbased on the principles summarized in the section 'psychophylaxis indentistry' . in difficult children it is often necessary to employ yetother psychological measures-psychotherapy, suggestion etc . inextremely exacting cases premedication helps sometimes to find contactwith the child .the experimental part of the work demonstrates the following findings1. dental treatment consists of a series of interdependenttraumatizing impulses . many of them appear only after a close analysisof the situation . 2. the adverse response similar to that elicited bypain may be due also to sensory impressions with a negative emotionalbackground . 3. psychic traumatization of the child during dentaltreatment can be prevented by relatively simple psychological measures .

3927. studies on growth and cytomorphosisin the thymo-lympha-tic systems - with specialreference to the influence ofthe thymus and the thyroidin guinea-pigsmigratory streams of lymphocytes betweendifferent parts of the thymo-lymphaticsystem were evaluated by comparisons betweenlymphocyte populations in thoracic-duct lymph and arterial and venous blood,especially thymic venous blood.  by re-cording organ weights in sham-operated andthymectomized guinea-pigs, treatedwith thyroxin or untreated, the importanceof the thymus and the thyroid for growthand regeneration in the thymo-lymphaticsystem was studied.  the main results areas follows.  there is a considerable venousoutput of lymphocytes with low mito-chondrial content (small lymphocytes) fromthe thymus in normal young guinea-pigs.this explains the much higher incidence ofsmall lymphocytes in blood than in tho-racic-duct lymph.  neonatal thymectomycauses lymphatic hypotrophy with defi-ciency of lymphocytes and pyroninophiliccells in relation to reticular ones.  bodygrowth and survival of the animals are notaffected.  in the thymus, exogenousthyroxin most probably promotes differentiationof large basophilic cells to smalllymphocytes, resulting in an increased output ofsmall lymphocytes.  in the lymphnodes, thyroxin promotes differentiation of largepyroninophilic cells ('transitionalcells') into immature and mature plasma cells.the effects of thyroxin on dif-ferentiation are followed by an increased growthof the thymo-lymphatic organs,characterized by an increased incidence of largebasophilic cells and increased weightof the lymphatic organs.  growth of the thymus andlymph nodes precedes that ofthe red splenic pulp.  this delayed splenic responseis not due to a transformationof an increased number of immigrated thymiclymphocytes, as neonatal thymectomydoes not prevent the thyroxin-stimulatedoccurrence of large basophilic cells in thered splenic pulp.  the thyroxin-stimulatedgrowth of the lymphatic system is ac-companied by an increased output of largerlymphocytes through the thoracicduct, resulting in an increased number oflarger lymphocytes in the blood.  inpostnatally thymectomized animals, having anormal (or above normal) amount ofcirculating small lymphocytes, thyroxin producesa drastic decrease in the number ofsmall blood lymphocytes, indicating a decreaseddelivery and/or increased disappear-ance of these cells to and from the blood, respectively.this decrease in number of smalllymphocytes is not seen in sham-operated animals.as judged by studies of organweights, the thyroxin-stimulated growth andregeneration of the lymphatic tissueare influenced antagonistically by thymectomyand synergistically by local factorsin involuted tissue.

implications of gerstmann's syndrome .of 465 consecutive patients subjected to a standardized battery ofneuropsychological tests, 111 had one or more components of gerstmann'ssyndrome . each of these 111 patients had some evidence of organic braindysfunction in addition to gerstmann components . as the number ofgerstmann components increased, the responsible brain lesions tended tobe larger, more highly destructive of tissue, and to cause greaterneurological impairment . every patient with four gerstmann componentshad associated evidence of severe impairment of brain functions and thelesion or underlying disease was likely to compromise survival of thepatient . the syndrome is not to be regarded as an autonomous entity,but merges with numerous other neurological deficits, notably dysphasiain agreement with benton, we find no justification for singling outthe four gerstmann components as a separate syndrome, unless one is alsoprepared to recognize that any other arbitrary groups of concurrentdeficits are also separate syndromes .in at least three of 23 patients with all four gerstmann components,the angular gyrus, as shown by necropsy examination, was not involved bythe lesion . however, the probability that the left hemisphere containeda lesion increased with the number of gerstmann components, and theprobability of involvement of the left posterior parasylvian area alsoincreased with the increase in the number of gerstmann components . withtwo, three, or four gerstmann components, the lesions were neverrestricted to the angular gyrus but tended to spread widely over theparietal, temporal, and occipital lobes . as to localizing significance,gerstmann's syndrome has approximately the same degree of cogency asdysphasia .

red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency--a newlyrecognized cause of neonatal jaundice and kernicterus in canadaseven male newborns of chinese, greek anditalian origin presented with severe hemo-lytic jaundice due to red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6-pd) defi-ciency.  in five, the hemolysis was precipi-tated by inhalation of mothball vapours inthe home.  kernicterus was evident uponadmission in six infants and was fatal infour of these.g-6-pd deficiency should be suspected asa cause of jaundice in all full-term maleinfants of these ethnic groups.  the diag-nosis can be confirmed in any hospital bythe methemoglobin reduction test.  in areassimilar to toronto, canada, where thesehigh-risk ethnic groups prevail, the follow-ing measures are recommended: (1) detec-tion of g-6-pd deficient newborns byscreening cord bloods of all infants of theseethnic groups: (2) protection of affectedinfants from potentially hemolytic agentssuch as naphthalene, certain vitamin kpreparations, and sulfonamides; and (3) ob-servation of serum bilirubin levels to assessthe need for exchange transfusion for hyper-bilirubinemia.

experiences with hgh treatment of twelve hypopituitarydwarfs for periods varying from 6 to 41 monthsare reported.  all the patients were considered to havehypopituitarism from birth, four of them of the hereditarytype, four possibly due to traumatic birth or neonatal asphyxia,and four from an unknown cause.  in sixpatients detailed information concerning growth duringthe first year of life could be obtained.  all of these patientshad a degree of growth retardation before oneyear of age.  we consider this to be the rule rather thanthe exception in pituitary dwarfism.  the most importantdiagnostic evidence was a marked degree of growth retardationaccompanied by a pronounced delay in skeletalmaturation, and, in most cases, signs of secondaryhypothyroidism, increased insulin sensitivity, and apoor response to metopyrone administration.  none ofthe patients who had passed the normal age of pubertyhad maturated sexually.  all twelve patients respondedwell to hgh therapy.  during the first year of treatmentthe average height increment was 10 cm. ('catch-up' growth).with continued treatment a normal rate ofgrowth, about 6 cm./year, was obtained.  there was nodisproportionate acceleration of skeletal maturation inany of the patients.  none of them has so far become resistantto hgh administration.  the oldest patient hasreached normal height.  whether this will be possiblenot only in the moderately severe, but also in the mostsevere cases of pituitary dwarfism, can not yet be stated.the possibility of using human gonadotrophic hormonesin an attempt to produce sexual maturation inthese patients is discussed briefly.

1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renalhomotransplantationdammin g. j.a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs hasbeen completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants.over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed.increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questionsregarding the status treated host.  the current drug protocol of azathioprineand diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50%100-day survivors.  the following observations have been documented  allanimals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapycan be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneysapparently are protected in some way in the new environment because asecond donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantationof a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decreasein renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted backto their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party,non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for theprolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a doubledose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption ormetabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results becausetwo kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in thesame drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient andthis sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned fromdrugs.  additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidneyhomografts reveal the following  skin homografts are universally rejectedwithin 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidneyhomografts sometimes permanently.  when skin and kidney homografts from thesame donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidneysurvival is shortened.  this paradoxical effect probably is explained by theproduction of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney.additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female,are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalizedimmunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.

248. data on etiology, pathogenesis, treatment results and survival period in560 patients with cirrhosis of the liverstatistics were compiled from a total of 560 cases chosen at random, ofcirrhosis of the liver.  the figures refer to the age and sex of the patients,as well as to the etiology and the hepatic morphology.  as the date of death of304 of the subjects was known, it was possible to calculate the survival timeafter the diagnosis was made.  only 36% survived the time of diagnosis by 1year, 16% by 3 years, and 8% by 5 years.  these figures show that moderntherapy of liver cirrhosis has up to now not succeeded to prolong the life ofthe majority of the victims.  in many cases, however, it is possible to a largeextent to relieve the patients' suffering by improving the appetite and thegeneral condition and by eliminating ascites and periods of hemorrhage andstupor.  particular attention should be paid to the prophylaxis of the diseaseand, by studying the survival time assessments and therapeutic reports, to themethod of selection of the subjects.

nephrogenic diabetes insipiduschlorothiazide has been found of value inestablishing and maintaining adequate hydra-tion in some patients; its exact mechanism ofaction is not known.  the antidiuretic effectsof chlorothiazide and its analogues have beenstudied in six patients with ndi, two ofwhom were infants less than six months ofage.  dehydrated infants showed a dramaticresponse to treatment.  with those unable toachieve an optimal fluid intake prior to treat-ment, the initial beneficial response was asso-ciated with an increased fluid intake.  follow-ing this initial antidiuretic response, a vari-able degree of "escape" or resistance to theaction of the drug commonly occurred.  de-spite the unpredictability of a prolonged anti-diuretic response, a therapeutic trial of chloro-thiazide in ndi seems warranted if diet aloneis not sufficient to maintain hydration.  it mustbe remembered, however, that this drug is po-tentially toxic.

radioautographic studies of bone marrow lymphocytes in vivo and indiffusion chamber cultures .radioautography with tritiated thymidine has been utilized to examinethe turnover rate and origin of small lymphocytes in the bone marrow ofthe guinea-pig .very few marrow lymphocytes were initially labeled by a singleinjection of tritiated thymidine, but thereafter the number of labeledlym phocytes rapidly increased to high maximum levels at 3 days .analysis of the labeling curves and grain counts indicates that thepopulation of marrow lymphocytes is maintained in a dynamic steady statewith an average turnover time of 3 days or less .suspensions of bone marrow cells were isolated from the circulationwithin intraperitoneal diffusion chambers after short-term labeling withtritiated thymidine in vivo . although very few small lymphocytes werelabeled when introduced into the diffusion chambers, a considerablepercentage became labeled during the subsequent culture period .tritiated thymidine was also administered intravenously whilstexcluded from one hind limb by the application of an occlusivecompression bandage for 20 minutes . very few labeled small lymphocyteswere found after 72 hours in the tibial marrow of the initially occludedlimb, whereas the normal high percentage was labeled in the controltibial marrow .these experiments do not demonstrate any large-scale influx of smalllymphocytes from the blood stream into the marrow parenchyma . theysuggest that newly formed small lymphocytes appear in the marrow as aresult of the division of locally situated precursor cells, but themechanism of intramedullary lymphocytopoiesis is uncertain ./transitional/ cells, intermediate in morphology between blast cells andsmall lymphocytes, synthesize dna and are actively proliferative, butthey do not appear to account fully for the rate of lymphocyteproduction .certain large, undifferentiated labeled cells appeared in the bonemarrow as a result of hematogenous migration . some implications ofthese findings are discussed .

biliary tract morphology and prognosisof biliary atresiain 86 infants who did not have extrahepatic "hepatic" ducts, presentobservation after use of artificialbile ducts suggests that the presence of thegallbladder may be of good prognostic significance in biliary atresia.there are 11 long-term survivors (as of october 1965) up to 8 1/4 years ofage (100 months) after use of artificial bile ducts in 86 babies.  agallbladder was identified in 10 of the 11 infants.other specific factors for this prolonged survival pattern in these infantswith biliary atresia have not yet been identified, although suggestivecorrelations among minimal hepatic fibrosis, maximal bile ductuleproliferations and the presence of the gallbladder were noted.it is suspected that if any opportunity for long-term survivals exists forinfants to overcome the tragic occurrence of biliary atresia that thesurgeon should avoid trauma to the hepatic pedicle.we may be able to provide a "guarded" rather than a "pessimistic" prog-nosis when the gallbladder is found in the babies with biliary atresia.

stimulus overload, action cycles, and the completion gradientsystematic inquiries into the origin of certain emotional disturbancesof infants show that consistent maternal care is vital for thechild's normal physical, psychic, and social development, indeed,for his survival.  the most elementary precondition for consistentmaternal care is the physical presence of the mother or her substitute.it has, however, become increasingly apparent that children'sdevelopment can also be stunted, and that they suffer damage ofvarying extent by the attention of, and close contact with, a motherwho dispenses what seems to be the "wrong kind of mothering".a model of the mother-baby interaction is proposed to explicatethe dynamics of the "wrong kind of mothering" and itsconsequences: my proposition is that the mutual exchanges betweenmother and baby consist in a give and take of action andreaction between the two partners, which requires from eachof them both active and passive responses.  these responses formseries and chains, the single links of which consist in what i call"action cycles," each completed in itself and at the same timeanticipating the next link.  i designated these seriated responseexchanges as the "precursor of dialogue," as a primal dialogue.the dialogue acts as a vector of the baby's development,influencing its direction and stimulating it to adaptive efforts andpsychic growth.  it follows that inappropriate mothering (quantitativelyas well as qualitatively) results in what is referred to atthis time as the "derailment" of the primal dialogue.controlled experiments with animals, findings of experimentalpsychology, and, lastly, clinical findings illustrate themechanics of the derailed dialogue and its sequelae.in the cases under review a surfeit of stimulation, a psychicoverloading, resulted in the derailment of dialogue.  overloadingprevents its subject from completing actions or responses initiatedby him.  long-lasting overload results in the cumulation of "incompletedaction cycles".  the sequelae of this cumulation areprofound changes in the behavior of the individual.  these changesare manifested in a departure from the norms of individual andsocial behavior patterns that are maladaptive for the individualand asyntonic with his society, that is, asocial.the derailment of the dialogue is triggered, perhaps evencaused,by the nature of the social setting.  one setting, over-population,is extensively discussed in connection with an animalexperiment, and the implications for the human community areexamined.

chemotherapy of breast cancerthe majority of cancer patients who arereferred for chemotherapy are in far advancedstages of the disease.  the difficulty in deliver-ing an effective dose of an oncolytic agentto the involved areas may limit the results oftreatment unless the patient's tumor is an un-usually responsive one.  the variability in re-sponse between apparently similar cases ofcancer of the same cell type has become in-creasingly evident, and is as puzzling as thefact that 20 per cent of patients with breastcancer will live 5 years with no treatment.  thedecisions as to the choice between chemother-apy and hormone therapy, as well as to thechoice of the chemotherapeutic agent to beemployed, may be difficult.as experience increases, the usefulness ofchemotherapy in the treatment of cancer isbecoming increasingly apparent.  it also has be-come apparent that chemotherapy cannot beregarded as a curative procedure in advancedcancer even though an occasional patient ap-pears to have been cured.  however, the valueof the oncolytic agents in prolonging usefulsurvival time, ameliorating many of the dis-tressing symptoms associated with cancer, andproviding the physician with an extra tool fora positive program in the care of the cancerpatient is now established.

chemotherapy of metastatic gastro-intestinal cancer.cancer of the digestive tract is the commonestcause of death from neoplastic disease in the unitedstates.  a large number of patients with these forms ofincurable cancer may be candidates for specific anti-tumordrug therapy.  the criteria employed for the selectionof patients for systemic or regional chemotherapyare reviewed and methods of treatment are outlined.systemic chemotherapy, using fluorinated pyrimidines,the antifol, methotrexate, and the alkylating agent, cytoxan,has been found to be of significant practical valuein 10 to 30% of the patients receiving these anticancerdrugs.  protracted hepatic artery infusion chemotherapyin patients with primary and secondary hepatic neoplasmsand tumors of the biliary system has resulted inobjective tumor response and associated clinical benefitin 60% of the patients treated.  length of survival hasbeen prolonged in patients with advanced metastatic livercancer from primary tumors of the colorectum.  it isconcluded that systemic and regional cancer chemotherapy,in selected cases, has contributed to the practicalmanagement of patients with incurable cancer of thegastrointestinal tract.

palliation by radiotherapythe purpose of radiotherapy in the managementof cancer of the lung is first to cure the disease;second, to prolong useful and comfortable exist-ence; and third, to provide comfort and relief ofsuffering to those who are symptomatic and in-curable.cancers of the lung vary quite widely in theirresponse to radiation.  those of glandular origin,the adenocarcinoma, are more often than not ofmodest susceptibility and sometimes quite resis-tant.  the very undifferentiated, the so-called oat-cell cancers, are often of exquisite sensitivity, re-sponding to irradiation almost like lymphomas.most cancer of the lung, however, is squamous-cellcarcinoma and as such may be considered to bemoderately radiosensitive in much the same orderof magnitude as squamous-cell carcinoma of theskin, cervix or larynx, and should, in theory, becurable by this means in the same degree.  unfor-tunately, this has to date not been found to betrue.  the reasons are principally two: first andforemost, by the time a diagnosis is made, cancerof the lung has more often than not, estimated at80% and more, spread beyond the site of origin,thus making cure by any effective means presentlyavailable unlikely.  second, the substrate in whichthe cancer grows, the lung, tolerates radiation lesswell than do the tissues which surround the highlyradiocurable epithelial cancers such as carcinoma ofthe skin, cervix, and larynx, thus making an un-favorable therapeutic ratio.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero andin vitro with rubella virus.a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomeswas undertaken to determine if damageto the genetic apparatus of human cells maybe induced by rubella virus and whethersuch damage produces the pathology seenin newborns from mothers infected earlyin pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains wereinitiated in vitro from embryonic materialobtained by therapeutic abortion of fetusesfrom rubella-infected mothers.  embryonicmaterial from spontaneous and non-rubellatherapeutic abortions yielded similarcell strains for infection in vitro.  theresults from both types of studies were asfollows: (a) virus shedding cell strains wereobtained from all types of organs cultivated,which indicated wide disseminationof virus in the fetuses from rubella-infectedmothers.  (b) chronic infection couldreadily be established by in vitro infectionand no cytopathic effect was noted.(c) although many strains continued to shedvirus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,no changes in growth propertiesoccurred with the exception that infectedstrains from lung tissue showed limitedgrowth capacities.  (d) from observationsof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obviouschromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctionalchanges were observed instrains infected naturally or experimentally.(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derivedcell strains there was a marked elevationin frequency of chromosome breakage in3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlationbetween virus shedding in vitro andincreased chromosome breakage was notedalthough this was not complete.  (g) thecombined average frequency of chromosomebreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortionstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortusstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,but significant elevation in average chromosomebreak frequency (9.8%) was obtainedin four cell strains which had been experimentallyinfected in vitro with rubella virus(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effectsupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,these were restricted to slight general elevationsin frequency of breakage abovenormal values.  very high increases in breakswere sporadic.  it appears more likelythat the general fetal abnormalities associatedwith rubella infection in vivo resultfrom possible effects of the virus upon growthrather than from effects upon thechromosomes.  however, the studies wererestricted to fibroblasts cultured invitro; and effects on other types of cellsmay have greater implications for thisquestion.

the effect of human growth hormone inhypopituitary dwarfismhuman growth hormone (hgh) raben has beenused in a dosage of 2 mg./m.2/day or 5 mg./m.2 twiceweekly.  this dosage is probably in or below, butcertainly not above, the range of physiologicalreplacement therapy.in a standardized five-day metabolic hgh testhypopituitary dwarfs retain more n than childrenwithout gh deficiency.  this test is valuablediagnostic help in hypopituitary dwarfism.a prolonged treatment with hgh acceleratesgrowth in hypopituitary dwarfs but not in childrenwithout gh deficiency.  growth rate, induced bythis treatment, is first above average and later averageor below average for age.  this decreasing responseto hgh is typical for the general phenomenon ofcatch-up growth and is not caused by the develop-ment of antibodies.of 9 hypopituitary dwarfs, treated for at least 9months, 3 were growth resistant from the beginningin spite of a high n retention in the preceding hghtest.  this resistance is caused by the developmentof high titres of specific hgh antibodies in the veryfirst few months of treatment.  these antibodiessuppress the effect of hgh both on metabolism andon growth.  the unexpected occasional induction inman of antibodies against a homologous proteinhormone is of great interest.  the possibility thatthese antibodies might be active not only against thehomogenous but also against the endogenous hormonecould have a far-reaching biological importance.

2302. the carcinogenic activities of n-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene and itsmetal chelates as a function of retention at the injection sitethe carcinogenic activities of s.c. administeredn-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene(n-hydroxy-aaf) and a variety of its metal chelates indicate that greateractivity locally is associated with a longer retention of the chelates at thesite of injection with a slow release of n-hydroxy-aaf to the surroundingtissue.  no tumors were obtained at the sites of 4 injections of n-hydroxy-aaf(3.2 mg. /injection), but 4 and 16 of 20 rats developed sarcomas at thesites of 8 and 16 injections, respectively.  the nickelous, cobaltous, ferric,or cupric chelates induced moderate to high incidences of sarcomas with 1 or 4injections; in these cases one-half of the administered n-hydroxy-aaf wasretained at the injection site for 4-50 days.  the manganous and zinc chelatesand the potassium salt were less active at the injection site; thehalf-retention times for these ranged from 2.5 hr. to 2.5 days.  the comparablehalf-retention time for n-hydroxy-aaf was about 2 hr.  injection of the metalderivatives s. c. with short half-retention times resulted in higher incidencesof mammary tumors than injection of the derivatives with half-retentiontimes of 4 or more days.  when administered in the food the cupric chelateof n-hydroxy-aaf induced the same spectrum of tumors as n-hydroxy-aaf,but the incidences were lower.  while the prolonged retention of the materialat the injection site may account for the greater carcinogenic activities ofthe metal chelates, serious consideration must also be given to the possibleimportance of chelation of carcinogens or their metabolites to cellularconstituents.

experimentelle nierenvergroberung nach unilateralernephrektomie bei rattenuntersuchungen mit 3h-thymidinin this paper it is attempted to clarify certain questions as to the mechanismof compensatory renal hypertrophy by means of histological, cytological, andautoradiographical examinations in nephrectomy experiments on young and grownrats.  based on the results of this investigation the process of compensatoryrenal hypertrophy must be imagined as follows:as early as two hours after unilateral nephrectomy, a distinct increase of themitosis index without a simultaneous increase in dna-synthesizing cells wasobserved in the remaining kidney.  it is assumed that a cell division ofpolyploid cells is involved, which were in a prolonged premitotic rest phase.after a latent period of 48 hours, the dna-synthesizing cells and dividingcells start to increase.  the maximum of the regenerative processes is reachedbetween the 3rd and 4th day after nephrectomy.  twenty days after unilateralnephrectomy, the regenerative processes are largely concluded.all tubule sections participate in the compensatory renal hypertrophy.although the regenerative processes are most marked in the central section,one cannot speak of the development of an actual indifference zone in theregenerating kidney.in young test animals, compensatory renal hypertrophy is determined moreby mitotic cell division, in older test animals more by polyploidizationprocesses.the results of these investigations provide no certain indications for theassumption that amitotic nuclear divisions play a major part in compensatoryrenal hypertrophy.proliferation processes which in extent and localization run parallel to theregeneration of the parenchyma, are also observed in the cells of theconnective tissue of the renal vessels.

the effect of folic acid on growth and deoxyribonucleic acid synthesisin the rat kidney.the effect of a single injection of folic acid (250mg/kg of body wt) on growth of the rat kidney was studied.the patterns of the response were found to be essentiallysimilar in animals aged between 3 wk and 12 mth.maximum values of kidney weight and nucleic acid content,relative to body weight, were found at 4 days atfolate administration.  the increases in wet and dryweights at this time were approx. 80% and 30% resp.above the control weights, and the percentage dry matterof the kidney was significantly lower than normal duringthis period.  at 4 days the rna content of the kidney wasalso maximal, being about 90% greater than the controlvalue, and the dna content after 4 days was increasedby about 60%.  whereas the dna values in 6-wk-old ratswere slightly lower at 7 and 10 days than at 4 days, in12-mth-old animals a further small increase was observedat 7 days, suggesting a prolongation of dna synthesisin the older animals.  autoradiographic studies ofdna synthesis with thymidine-h have shown a greatlyincreased labeling index in all zones of the kidney followingfolate injection.  maximum values were observedat 48 hr in the cortical zone, but the patterns of thechanges in the medulla were less well defined.  the labellingindices in the kidneys of 12-mth-old rats remainedabove normal for a longer period than in 6-wk-old rats.these results concur with the evidence of an increaseddna contents of the kidneys of older rats between 4 and7 days after folate.

2354. isoantigenic properties of tumors transgressing histocompatibilitybarriers of the h-2 systemsublines capable of transgressing h-2 histocompatibilitybarriers have been derivedfrom strictly strain-specific tumors by 1) passagethrough newborn hosts of aforeign genotype; 2) passage through adult h-2incompatible recipients pretreatedwith isoantisera directed against the tumor cells.the nonspecific character inducedby these procedures was usually expressed in anumber of different h-2 incompa-tible recipients.  the changes responsible forthe conversion to nonspecific growthappeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion.expression of the nonspecific characterrequired exposure to the foreign host environmentfor more than 30 days.  at thisstage and during the subsequent 3 transfergenerations, reversion to strain-specificgrowth occurred on back-transfer to thestrain of origin; after 4 passages in theforeign hosts the nonspecific character waspermanently established, however, andcould not be reverted by prolonged passagein the original host genotype.  thegrowth rate of strain-specific tumors andtheir nonspecific sublines was comparedin the strain of origin.  no difference wasfound with one tumor, while the strain-specific line grew better than the nonspecificsublines with another.  this differencewas detected in the homozygous strain oforigin and in different semi-isologous f1hybrids.  all lines grew better in thehomozygous strain than in the f1 hybrids,however.  a comparison was madebetween the concentration of h-2 isoantigenicsurface determinants in strain-specifictumors and their nonspecific sublines by aquantitative absorption technique invitro.  all nonspecific sublines had a lowerconcentration of h-2 isoantigens thanthe strain-specific tumors.  this suggeststhat nonspecific tumors develop as a resultof immunoselection of variants resistantto the homograft reaction and are characterizedby a lowered concentration ofh-2 antigens.

198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note ofcautionazathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classifiedas 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects ofazathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because ofthe concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during theadministration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolongedsteroid therapy.  in 1 patient, the administration of azathioprine wasassociated with amelioration of an arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum which didnot respond to the use of steroids and other medication.  immuno-suppressiveobservations were limited.  the established delayed hypersensitivity response,as reflected in various skin tests, was unchanged during the administration ofazathioprine.  azathioprine had no discernible toxic effects upon the kidneysor the liver in 2 patients, 1 with postnecrotic cirrhosis and the other withserum hepatitis.  gastro-intestinal symptoms (anorexia, epigastric discomfort,and nausea) occurred in 8 patients.  mild to moderate leukopenia developed in 8patients and, in 2 individuals, was accompanied by thrombocytopenia.  temporaryalopecia occurred in 1 woman.  the hematopoietic effects developed within 2 or3 wk of therapy with azathioprine at a dosage level of 4-6 mg/kg/day.azathioprine does not exert the rapid beneficial effect in ulcerative colitisnoted with corticotropin and adrenal corticosteroids.  therefore, its use insevere ulcerative colitis requiring intensive therapy probably is undesirable.azathioprine, on the basis of these initial observations, may be considered formoderately severe ulcerative colitis, under circumstances permitting controlledand prolonged therapeutic trial as adjunct medication, but with carefulsupervision for prevention of toxicity, especially leukopenia.

eeg abnormalities in early childhood schizophrenia:a double-blind study of psychiatrically distrubedand normal children during promazine sedationeeg tracings during promazine sedationwere obtained on 58 children who hadautistic or symbiotic childhood psychosis.for comparison eeg's were done underidentical conditions on 4 other groups ofchildren: 44 with chronic undifferentiatedschizophrenia; 37 non-psychotic childrenwith severe, acting-out behavior disorders;10 with neuroses; and 13 psychiatricallynormal children.  final clinical diagnoseswere made without knowledge of the eegreadings as determined for this study, andthe eeg's were all placed in random orderand read without any knowledge of theclinical diagnosis.  eeg abnormalities ac-cepted were focal slowing, focal spikes,paroxysmal spikes and waves, and par-oxysmal spikes and waves with independentspikes.among the 149 patients 51% had abnormalrecords.  none of the psychiatrically normalchildren had eeg abnormalities.  exceptfor the neurotics, the eeg abnormalitieswere qualitatively and quantitatively sim-ilar in the psychiatric patients.  themost frequent abnormalities were ir-regular paroxysmal spike and wave com-plexes, often best seen during thetransition from wake to sleep.  of the 149patients, 33% had this complex, either aloneor with independent spikes.  although thesecomplexes were most frequent in the au-tistic-symbiotic group, the incidence wasnot statistically significantly different fromthe higher performing, chronic undiffer-entiated schizophrenics who had communi-cative speech or the non-psychotic childrenwith acting-out behavior disorders.of the 58 autistic-symbiotic children, 19%had seizures, which is similar to the 13%seizure incidence in the remaining 91 psy-chiatric patients.whether the cerebral dysfunction im-plied by this study is a primary disorderor is secondary to some factor such as theeffect of prolonged anxiety on body chem-istry cannot be decided at this time.  never-theless, an organic concomitant has beendemonstrated in 51% of the psychiatricallydisturbed children.  by increasing theamount of time included in the eeg sam-ple, the incidence of electrical abnormalitiesmight be even higher.

epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) as a therapeutic agent based on 5years clinical experience.experience in the treatment of 744 patients withe-aca suggested that the use of the preparation is indicatedin the following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhagein association with delivery.  (2) acute systemicfibrinolysis in association with surgery.  it ismainly major operations on the thorax, pancreas, prostate,liver and genital organs that are complicated byfibrinolysis, but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur afterany operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis in patientswith cancer, particularly cancer of the prostateand pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicatingvarious disorders, especially leukaemia, livercirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote inthrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activityin the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduceblood losses following prostatectomy, especially if thetreatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopicallyclear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumaticinjury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia andother coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effectivewhether given orally or intravenously.  in stateswith increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity inthe urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day hasproved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug one.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function testswere observed, not even in cases receiving more than1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs ofintravascular coagulation in connection with e-acatherapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications after prostatectomy in patientstreated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.judging from the authors' experience in this materiale-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.

five-year comparative study of hydrocephalus inchildren with and without operation (113 cases)on the basis of a 5-year study of 113 hy-drocephalic children of whom 65 were oper-ated on early with ventriculo-atrial shuntingand 48 were not operated on, all of them hav-ing been studied periodically in a similarmanner to determine mortality, morbidity,intelligence, and related factors, the follow-ing conclusions are justified:the program in which shunting opera-tions were done apparently gives significantadvantages to the children over the programin which no shunting operations were done(based on life-table data projected from birthto 10 years)survival: 61.8 per cent as compared to22.2 per cent;number of competent children (i.q. of75 or better): 33.8 per cent vs. 5.5 percent;number of noncompetitive children(i.q. below 75): 27.6 per cent vs. 16.7per cent.the major cause of death and morbid-ity in both groups is infection.in the operative group, morbidityassociated with the shunting procedure isrelated to obstruction of the shunt andsepticemia.  the early occlusions show acorrelation with abnormal, inflammatorytype of spinal fluid being shunted into theblood stream.  the late obstructions areassociated with mechanical breakage of theshunt or factors of growth causing retractionof the cardiac end from the atrium.  promptre-establishment of a functioning shunt hasbeen possible in all instances.  periodic follow-up examinations, irrespective of symptoms,have proved invaluable in early recognitionof malfunctioning shunts.  septicemia usuallyrequired removal of the shunt.from the program of periodic evalua-tions, including "bubble" ventriculograms,studies of clearance of risa, and psycho-logical testings, correlations showed:intellectual ability seemed associatedwith width of cerebral mantle;width of cerebral mantle in hydrocepha-lus decreases with ventricular pressuresof 120 or over; it increases with pres-sures less than this;prolonged shunting of cerebrospinalfluid can give dramatic increase inwidth of cerebral mantle, apparentlyirrespective of basic etiology of thehydrocephalus;intellectual capacity could not be cor-related with the basic etiology of thehydrocephalus, but did correlate in-versely with duration of increased in-tracranial pressure.the many etiologies of hydrocephalusrequire large numbers of patients in eachgroup for thorough evaluation.  factorsfavoring such studies should be carried out inmedical centers where appropriate disciplinescan study in depth.  prevention should be theultimate goal.in the operative group, only 1 patientcompensated his hydrocephalic process andno single patient demonstrated "arrest" of orrecovery from the basic hydrocephalus-pro-ducing process in spite of numerous attemptsto demonstrate this.  this might imply anecessity for life-long shunting of cerebro-spinal fluid in these cases.

1770. proliferative activity of thelymphatic tissues of rats asstudied with tritium-labelledthymidinecytokinetic data are presented, employingquantitation of h3dna in the lymphatictissues of normal rats serially sacrificedafter h3tdr administration.  a markeddifference in the patterns of initial labelingand label loss was observed between thethymus and peripheral lymphatic tissue.the data are compatible with other indica-tions of rapid cell renewal in the thymus.there is suppression of initial uptake ofh3tdr into the dna of each large lymphocyticprogenitor cell in the thymus, appa-rently because of a feedback of thymidinecontaining material from small lympho-cytes in the thymus.  depletion of the thymusof small cells, as by operative stressor whole body x-ray, leads to a markedincrease in the uptake of h3tdr into thedna of large thymocytes.  this finding,which is in agreement with the previousfindings of sugino et al. suggesting transferof thymine nucleotides from small thy-mus lymphocytes to precursor cells, may ormay not be related to the apparenttransfer of dna label between thymic cells.the evidence for the latter consists ofthe curvilinear dilution of the dna label inthe thymus proliferating cell populationand the relationship between the rate of dnalabel dilution in large cells and thedna in the small cells in the thymus.  afterthe dna label in progenitor cells inthe thymus and lymph nodes has entered thesmall cell population, the subsequentdilution of grains in these dividing cells followsthe same slope as the loss of radio-activity from the entire lymph node.  there is along retention of some h3dna labelin the dividing lymph node cell population.  thissuggests that the loss of radioacti-vity from the dividing cells and from the smallcell population as a whole occurs e-qually.  this pattern prevails regardless ofwhether the percentage of large andsmall cells is altered experimentally.  thesefindings can be explained by an inter-change of the dna nuclear label between smalllymphocytes and large lymphocytes.this could occur by some process such asphagocytosis or pinocytosis, or by trans-formation of the small lymphocyte into a large,dividing cell.  the data fit best withthe latter possibility.  all or any of thesemechanisms would lead to an equilibrationof the dna label between large and smallcells.  this finding prevents the assign-ment of a finite life span to lymphocytes onthe basis of dna labeling kinetics.  ne-vertheless, there appear to be at least twodifferent types of lymphocytes.  one,the 'thymus-type' lymphocyte, is found in thethymus cortex, bone marrow and ger-minal centers of lymphoid follicles.  the othertype, found abundantly in the wide-spread peripheral lymphatic tissue, shows avery prolonged retention of dna la-bel and is believed to be recirculating,'immunologically committed' cells describedby others.  these cells do not appear toenter the thymus cortex.
