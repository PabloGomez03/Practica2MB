studies on compensatory renal hypertrophy.  i.  effect ofunilateral ureteral ligation and transectiondata are presented comparing the relative rateof compensatory renal hypertrophyand hyperplasia of the control kidney of ratsfollowing either unilateral ureteraltransection, ligation, or nephrectomy.  the growthof the control kidney on the unoperatedside was strikingly slower after ureteraltransection and ligation whencompared with that resulting from the removalof one kidney.  progressive hydronephrosiswas observed on the operated side followingureteral transection andligation and was more pronounced in the latter.degree of hypertrophy of the controlkidney showed a close correlation with degree andduration of the hydronephrosis ofthe kidney on the operated side.  these observationshave been interpreted as indicatingthe operation of a control system regulatingkidney growth in response tochanges in some way related to kidney size.

the role of age and x-irradiation on kidneyfunction in the mousefemale mouse kidneys show a decline with respect to age in the ability toconcentrate the urine during a 24-hour water fast.  x-irradiation early inlife has no measurable long-term effect on this process.kidney cortex slices of old female mice can concentrate p-aminohippuricacid against a concentration gradient equally as well as slices from youngmice.  there is no loss in this ability by cortex slices from young or oldfemale x-irradiated mice.it is uncertain whether compensatory renal hypertrophy after unilateralnephrectomy declines with age in nonirradiated mice.  x-irradiation doescause a reduction in the degree of compensatory renal hypertrophy in the agingmouse.  this reduction may represent a loss in the ability of kidney cells toundergo cell division.the administration of testosterone propionate to old mice during compen-satory renal hypertrophy results in an increased hypertrophy.  the increase isrelatively the same for irradiated and nonirradiated mice, indicating the lackof a long-term effect of x-irradiation to reduce the ability of a targetorgan to respond to a hormone.the over-all conclusion of this study, with respect to "radiation-inducedaging," is that x-irradiation of the female swiss mouse early in life does nothave a pronounced effect on kidney function late in life but may have a long-term effect on those processes concerned with cell division.

experimentelle nierenvergroberung nach unilateralernephrektomie bei rattenuntersuchungen mit 3h-thymidinin this paper it is attempted to clarify certain questions as to the mechanismof compensatory renal hypertrophy by means of histological, cytological, andautoradiographical examinations in nephrectomy experiments on young and grownrats.  based on the results of this investigation the process of compensatoryrenal hypertrophy must be imagined as follows:as early as two hours after unilateral nephrectomy, a distinct increase of themitosis index without a simultaneous increase in dna-synthesizing cells wasobserved in the remaining kidney.  it is assumed that a cell division ofpolyploid cells is involved, which were in a prolonged premitotic rest phase.after a latent period of 48 hours, the dna-synthesizing cells and dividingcells start to increase.  the maximum of the regenerative processes is reachedbetween the 3rd and 4th day after nephrectomy.  twenty days after unilateralnephrectomy, the regenerative processes are largely concluded.all tubule sections participate in the compensatory renal hypertrophy.although the regenerative processes are most marked in the central section,one cannot speak of the development of an actual indifference zone in theregenerating kidney.in young test animals, compensatory renal hypertrophy is determined moreby mitotic cell division, in older test animals more by polyploidizationprocesses.the results of these investigations provide no certain indications for theassumption that amitotic nuclear divisions play a major part in compensatoryrenal hypertrophy.proliferation processes which in extent and localization run parallel to theregeneration of the parenchyma, are also observed in the cells of theconnective tissue of the renal vessels.

compensatory renal enlargementhypertrophy versus hyperplasiaafter unilateral nephrectomy in the mouse, the compensatory growthof the remaining kidney is characterized by an increase in rna andprotein synthesis within the first hour.  dna synthesis remains un-changed for about 18 hours and then rises to a maximum at 48 hours.  bythe end of the fifth day, when dna synthesis has passed its peak and isin decline, cellular hyperplasia has accounted for only one-fourth of theincrease in kidney weight.  thus it is shown that cell hypertrophy is boththe primary and the predominant response in the early phase of compen-satory renal enlargement.

the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney and thezona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex inthe sodium losing and the hypertensiveforms of virilizing adrenalhyperplasiapathological and biochemical observationsare presented in two cases of virilizing ad-renal hyperplasia: one of the sodium-losingtype and the other of the hypertensive type.examination of the kidneys revealed hyper-trophy of the juxtaglomerular cells in thecase exhibiting excessive sodium loss.  theadrenal cortex showed hypertrophy of thezona glomerulosa.  it is hypothesized thatthe chronic state of sodium loss causedchanges in the intravascular compartmentwhich led to compensatory activity of thejuxtaglomerular cells with resultant stimula-tion of the zona glomerulosa.examination of the hypertensive case(known to involve a different enzyme defi-cit) showed hypertrophy of the zona glom-erulosa without hypertrophy of the juxta-glomerular cells.  the intrinsic overproduc-tion of sodium-retaining steroids associatedwith the genetic defect in this clinical formcould account for both the hypertensionand the absence of hypertrophy of the juxta-glomerular apparatus.

renal and adrenal relationshipsin compensatory hyperplasiathe compensatory renal hyperplasia thatnormally follows unilateral nephrectomyis abolished by bilateral adrenalectomy ifrats are maintained on fresh drinkingwater, but is restored when saline drinkingwater is provided or if such animals areinjected with doca.  the adrenals are alsoimportant for the increased proliferationcaused by unilateral hydronephrosis.  theseexperiments suggest that the role of theadrenal cortex in renal hyperplasia may be tosecrete mineralocorticoids, whichpromote the retention of sodium and therebystimulate cell division in the kidneys.

the effect of nortestosterone phenylpropionate on compensatoryhypertrophy of the remaining kidney after unilateral nephrectomy.forty-eight hr. after unilateral nephrectomy,both in non-castrated and in castratedmale mice the relative dry weight of theremaining kidney increased significantly.this compensatory hypertrophy was significantlystimulated as early as 96 hr. afteroperation by treatment with 19-nortestosteronephenylpropionate (= npp) at thetime of operation.  the percentual increaseof the kidney weight was approximatelythe same in non-castrated as in castratedmice.  the absolute initial values as wellas the resulting values 96 hr. after operationwere higher in non-castrated malemice than in castrated animals.  the numberof cells and the dna concentration perg. tissue decreased during the period ofnon-stimulated compensatory hypertrophyin both groups of animals.  npp caused a stillfurther decrease.  the concentrationof dna per cell did not change.  followingnon-stimulated compensatory hypertrophy,there was no change in the rna concentrationper g. tissue or per cell in castratedmice.  in non-castrated mice the concentrationincreased.  npp caused approximatelythe same percentual increase of rnaconcentration in non-castrated as incastrated animals during the period of compensatoryhypertrophy.  the difference betweenboth groups of mice in the rnaconcentration in the remaining kidneyfollowing stimulation of the compensatoryhypertrophy by npp was statistically significant.

hypertensive vascular disease produced by homologous renin.administration of rat renin to uninephrectomizedrats reproduced most, if not all,the changes (hypertension, vascular disease,hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosaof the adrenals) found after partial constrictionof the renal artery.  this is takenas evidence that the renal pressor systemplays a major role in the pathogenesisof renal hypertension.

cell proliferationin experimental hydronephrosisand compensatory renal hyperplasiamitosis counts and autoradiographic counts of nuclei labeled withtritiated thymidine were made in the renal cortex of male rats in whichthe left ureter was ligated.  these were compared with correspondingcounts in the remaining kidney after left nephrectomy, and in sham-operated controls 24, 48 and 72 hours after operation.  the cortex ofthe kidney on the obstructed side showed a greater number of tritium-labeled nuclei and mitotic figures than in the kidney undergoing com-pensatory hyperplasia.  epithelial and interstitial cells responded simul-taneously on the obstructed side, whereas in the remaining kidney afternephrectomy, the epithelial response preceded a slight interstitial re-sponse by 48 hours.  the contralateral kidney in rats subjected toureteral ligation showed no response.we concluded that the early response of increased dna synthesisand cell division in the obstructed kidney was not mediated by humoralfactors; it was localized and probably had a different mechanism thanthe proliferative response occurring in compensatory renal hyperplasia.

abscopal effects of whole-bodyx-irradiation on compensatory hypertrophyof the rat kidney.the weight and dna content of normal growing (i.e., intact), andhypertrophying (i.e., following uninephrectomy) rat kidneys wereobtained from several hundred sprague-dawley white rats.  theeffect of whole body x irradiation with 500 rad and local irradiationto the kidney with 1000 rad, was then determined by following therate and degree of hypertrophy and the dna content of the kidney.when calculated on the basis of body surface area, a constant ratioof kidney weight and of kidney dna was found in the normal, non-hypertrophying kidneys of 5-12 week old rats.  after 21 days ofhypertrophy these values increased approximately 50 per cent overnormal in rats 4-6 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy.  foranimals 6-14 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy the correspondingincrease was only about 20 per cent.following uninephrectomy and x irradiation with 1000 rad to theexteriorized remaining kidney, 4 week old rats whose bodies werelead-shielded during irradiation showed no body weight growthretardation, no significant difference in the dna content of thekidney, and a small but significant decrease in weight incrementof the hypertrophying kidney after 21 days.rats exposed to 500 rad of x rays with the kidney shielded duringirradiation, when compared with nonirradiated controls, showed bodyweight growth retardation, a reduction in the dna content of thekidney, and a reduction in the amount of kidney hypertrophy 21 daysfollowing uninephrectomy.  a still greater inhibition of both kidneycompensatory hypertrophy and the increase in dna content of thekidney occurred after 500 rad whole body irradiation.food restriction in nonirradiated 4 week old rats resulting inbody weight growth retardation, elicited a marked reduction inkidney weight and in dna content of the hypertrophying kidney 21days after uninephrectomy.it is concluded that the reduction in kidney hypertrophy followingwhole body x irradiation with 500 rad is due in some measure to anabscopal or indirect effect, secondary to decreased body weight.

cell proliferation in compensatory renal growthrats with one kidney removed showed a progressive increase in weight of theremaining kidney over a six-week period.autoradiographic and radiochemical studies with 3h-thymidine indicated that theincrease in new kidney cell formation was maximal forty-eight to seventy-twohours after unilateral nephrectomy.  this early response was chiefly due to theproduction of new cells by the renal cortical tubules.  normal rates of tubulecell turnover were achieved two weeks after operation.  the glomerular tuftscontained fewer new cells and their peak production was delayed to theone-week period with a slow decline thereafter.rats forty-eight hours after unilateral nephrectomy were chosen as a model tostudy the effect of various substances on the magnitude of new cell formation.the number of dna-synthesising cells in the stimulated kidney was reduced bytreatment with hydrocortisone, acth, 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, and1,2-benzanthracene; the numbers were increased by the administration ofdeoxycorticosterone and aldosterone.

parathyroid function in chronic renal failure.  a statistical surveyof the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy.a collection has been made of 134 personal andpublished cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in whichadequate information was available concerning thepathological state of the bones.  measurements wereavailable of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, andblood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonateand plasma proteins in a representative sample.the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the wholeseries of 134 cases were not related reciprocally butwere correlated directly.  these data were further analyzedby allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups,according to the type of pathological lesions present inthe bones.  in one group there was evidence of defectivemineralization of skeletal tissues, in the form of eitherrickets or osteomalacia, and the plasma-calcium wasfound to be statistically sub-normal.  in the other groupthere was no primary defect of mineralization but thelesions of generalized osteitis fibrosa were present andthe plasma calcium was statistically normal.  there wasno significant correlation between the plasma levels ofcalcium and phosphate in either sub-group; and the plasmaphosphate was significantly higher in the group withthe higher plasma calcium levels.  the data indicate thatin patients with renal osteodystrophy, contrary to generalbelief, the plasma calcium varies independently of theplasma phosphate.  since these results imply differencesin parathyroid function among patients with azotemicosteodystrophy, a survey has also been made ofthe recorded parathyroid weights in chronic renal failure.generalized osteitis fibrosa and the accompanying normallevels of plasma calcium are associated with greaterparathyroid hypertrophy than is found in most casesof chronic renal failure or cases with defective mineralization.the various data are interpreted in relationto the known metabolic disturbances and natural historyof azotemic osteodystrophy.  by analogy with states ofsimple vitamin d deficiency, it is suggested that hypocalcemiaand relative unresponsiveness to the calcemicaction of parathyroid hormone are related to an acquiredresistance to vitamin d.  the group of cases with statisticallynormal plasma-calcium prove that the parathyroidglands can function effectively in some patientswith chronic renal failure, irrespective of the level ofthe plasma phosphate.  the size of the glands and theeffects of sub-total parathyroidectomy in patients of thisgroup suggest that the normal plasma calcium resultsfrom an increased production of parathyroid hormone.the more advanced renal failure in the normocalcemic,as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could meanthat the development of an effective degree of secondaryhyperparathyroidism is a function of the duration of therenal disease.  it seems likely that when the parathyroidresponse is sufficient to overcome the effects of the vitamind resistance it also entails the development of generalizedosteitis fibrosa, healing of the defect of mineralizationand increased liability to metastatic calcification.

chemical aspects of compensatory renal hypertrophythe effect of unilateral nephrectomy on the size and composition of theremaining kidney has been investigated in rats.  in normal rats the rightkidney is, on the average, significantly heavier than the left and has ahigher total content of dna and rna.  the 2 kidneys have almost identicalratios of rna/dna and protein/dna.  after unilateral nephrectomy the survivingkidney increases steadily in wet and dry weight for the 1st 4 days after theoperation.  this is accompanied by a much slower increase in total dnacontent and by a dramatic increase in rna/dna ratio.the rna/dna ratio in kidney is also affected by diet, being higher on ahigh-protein than on a low-protein intake.  moreover, the rise in rna/dnaratio that follows unilateral nephrectomy is greater in animals fed ahigh-protein diet.  the changes in kidney weight and in total contents of dna,rna, protein, and lipid phosphorus resulting from the feeding of a high-proteindiet were found to be of approximately the same magnitude as those in theremaining kidney 4 days after unilateral nephrectomy.  the rna/dna andprotein/dna ratios are also greater in rats fed a diet containing 10% urea,but the increase is much less than that in the remaining kidney afterunilateral nephrectomy.

renal factors in the pathogenesis of hypertensionrenal arteriography and other modern diagnostic procedures have providedthe means of establishing a close relationship between high blood pressure andrenovascular disease.  many of these cases are amenable to surgical cure.  atthe present time there is no single test for the definitive diagnosis of renalhypertension.  careful and intensive studies are mandatory in the selection ofcases suitable for surgery, since hypertension has many etiologic factors andinvolves many complex and sometimes obscure mechanisms.  aortography,intravenous urography and split-function tests are among the most importantmethods for definitive diagnosis and for the planning of appropriate surgicalprocedures.at operation, the most commonly observed cause of renal arterial con-striction in the elderly is atherosclerosis, whereas in younger patients it ishyperplasia of the intimal and muscular coats of the renal artery and itsbranches.  renovascular surgery may require a variety of technical procedures.in the successful cases there is a striking and permanent reduction in bloodpressure.the accuracy of blood pressure readings is emphasized, since hypertensionis usually discovered for the first time during the course of a routinephysical examination.

the action of vasopressin in renal diabetes insipidus.as the water-retaining action of antidiuretichormone is eliminated in renal diabetesinsipidus, the steps in na transport canbe separately determined.  vasopressininduced a prompt increase in freewaterclearance and urinary volume, as wellas a delayed increase in sodium clearance.it is suggested that vasopressin bringsabout stimulation of sodium reabsorption inthe ascending limb of henle's loop.  itis supposed that both physiological actionsof antidiuretic hormone - the antidiureticand the sodium-active effect - become operativein two different places in the nephronand synergistically produce a maximumconcentration of urine.

localization of phosphaturic effect ofparathyroid hormone in nephron of the dogthe renal mechanism and tubular site of the phosphaturic action ofparathyroid hormone were investigated by clearance and stop-flowtechniques in one intact and seven thyroparathyroidectomizeddogs.  administration of hormone caused a significant increasein the excretion of phosphate without increasing the filteredload.  stop-flow analysis indicated that in the absence of parathyroidhormone most of the filtered phosphate was reabsorbedin the proximal tubule, and that the hormone increased therate of phosphate excretion by inhibiting this reabsorptivemechanism.  p32 injected during stopped flow showed no significanttransport across the renal tubule despite the presence ofexcess parathyroid hormone.  significant p32 activity appearedin the stop-flow collections simultaneously with the appearanceof new filtrate.  there was no evidence that parathyroid hormonemediated a secretory process for phosphate excretion.

effects of hypophysectomy and growth hormone on renal compensatoryhypertrophy in rats.the effect of hypophysectomy on renal compensatoryhypertrophy (rch) was observed in unilaterallynephrectomized rats receiving no therapy and thosereceiving replacement therapy and was compared to therch attained by non-hypophysectomized unilaterallynephrectomized rats at 2, 5, and 10 days.  in the lattergroup there was an initial rapid rch seen at day 2which continued, but at a slower rate, through day 10.in the hypophysectomized group without replacementtherapy there was also an initial rch in the first 48 hrs.however, instead of the rch continuing there was aregression in kidney size at 5 days and with no subsequentchange at 10 days.  in the hypophysectomized groupreceiving hormone replacement there was an initialrch comparable to the other 2 groups, but the furtherrenal enlargement at 10 days was much less than thatof the non-hypophysectomized animals.  the results ofthis experiment and of other reported studies implyexistence of a renotropic factor which is not producedin the pituitary, but which requires an intact pituitaryfor full effectiveness.

concurrence of hyperplasia andneoplasia of the parathyroid glandsthe concurrence of parathyroid hyperplasiaand neoplasia in a group of six patients is re-ported.  two patients had long-standing renaldisease with azotemia and hyperphosphatemia.in both hypercalcemia developed while theywere under observation and they were found tohave parathyroid adenomas as well as hyper-plasia of the other glands.  a third patientfollowed an apparently similar course.  one pa-tient with primary hyperparathyroidism due to alarge mediastinal adenoma displayed hyper-plasia of other glands in association with moder-ate renal insufficiency.  two patients with pri-mary generalized parathyroid hyperplasia werefound to have superimposed neoplastic lesions:multiple adenomatous nodules in one, adenocar-cinoma in the other.these observations add new dimensions to thediagnosis and therapy of parathyroid disorders.they indicate the necessity of examining all fourparathyroid areas at time of surgery.  they alsoemphasize that hypercalcemia developing inpatients with chronic renal disease is a manifesta-tion of autonomous parathyroid function.

visual neglect .clinical trainees in nursing and in psychology from boston college andsimmons college, boston, mass., collected data and observed patientsunder the direction of the authors in a pilot program designed tomeasure visual spatial neglect and to develop rehabilitative material .these measurements and exercises might also be used by nurses in theircare of those patients who have had cerebral vascular accidents .the diversity of daily activities in which the patient becomesinvolved during his hospitalization should provide some indication ofthe extent to which the compensatory visual neglect therapeutics havebeen effective . more formal estimates can be obtained byre-administering the battery of visual neglect tests at periodicintervals . nursing personnel adopting a program of therapeutics such asthis must bear in mind that patients suffering cerebral insult areusually less adaptive than their nonbrain-injured peers . they developnew habit patterns slowly and regression often will follow apparentfixation at a more adaptive level of response habituation(11) . however,experimental inquiry has shown that the dimension of behavioraldifference between the brain-injured adults and normal adults is one ofdegree rather than kind -dash a difference that skilled nursing canoften reduce(12) .

auto-radiographic studies of the protein metabolism of the singlekidney in the nephrectomized rat.rats were subjected to unilateral nephrectomy,following which the protein metabolismof the other kidney, which exerteda compensatory activity, was studiedwith h-labelled l-phenylalanine, at differentintervals (3hr. to 7 wk.).  twophases of enhanced incorporation of amino-acidsinto the cells of the convolutedtubules were found, with one maximumafter 6 hr., at which time the uptake islimited to the cytoplasm, and a 2nd maximumon the 4th day, when the nucleus isequally involved.  in the course of the 2ndphase of enhanced amino-acid uptake,there is also an increased mitotic indexof the epithelia of the tubules.  in thecollecting tubules, there was only one phaseof enhanced amino-acid uptake, with amaximum on the 4th day, also coincidingwith an increased mitotic index.  theincrease of the number of cells of the kidneywas determined by a study of the variationsof the mitotic index.  the meanmultiplication factor in the beginning amountsto 1.6.  the protein metabolism is increased1.3 times.  the increase of the volume(factor 1.3) and the increase of the proteinmetabolism per unit of volume (factor 1.3)of the hypertrophic kidney result in atotal increase of the protein metabolismof 2.1 times, once the adaptation processis complete, so that the residual kidneyhas approximately the same proteinmetabolism as 2 normal kidneys.

selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially preparedantisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrinclearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecularweights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and theslope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be saidto express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfyingthe usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephroticsyndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greaterthan the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially tosteroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changesobserved on renal biopsy .2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephroticsyndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type ofproteinuria .3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for agiven pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome .4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to thetotal daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remainsfairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein beingexcreted .5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance betweenthe degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of thedisease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initialblood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type ofprotein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and hadinitially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity typeor better .7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic andhas a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy isunlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulinclearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted withany degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with thenephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise .

role of the liver in the glycoprotein mobilizing property ofparathyroid extractstudies were carried out to de-termine the action of hepatectomy on theglycoprotein action of pte as well as onpte-induced renal calcification and deposi-tion of glycoprotein.  our data showed thatin hepatectomized rats, pte no longer causedan elevation in serum glycoproteins.  how-ever, hepatectomy did not alter the forma-tion of glycoprotein tubular casts producedby pte administration.  the data suggestthat the liver is the major source of the ele-vated serum glycoproteins found in rats re-ceiving pte.  in addition, it is possible thatpte may have a direct stimulating actionon biosynthesis of glycoprotein by the kidney.

pathogenesis of polycystic kidneysmicrodissection confirms our previous de-scription of an uncommon variety of poly-cystic kidney found only in the newbornperiods.  it is characterized by symmetricalenlargement caused by saccular or cylindri-cal increase in size of all collecting tubules.the number and relative length of differentgenerations of collecting tubules are normal.nephrons are present in normal numbers,and their attachment to collecting tubules isnormal.  the pattern of the nephrons is nor-mal except for minimal localized areas ofdilatation.  interstitial connective tissue isnot increased.  intrahepatic bile ducts are in-variably cystic.  siblings may be affected.we believe that in such kidneys the be-havior of the ampullae of the branches of theureteral bud is normal and that secondaryhyperplasia of the interstitial portions of thebranches is responsible for the greatly in-creased renal size.

the action of oral diureticsin diabetes insipiduschronic administration of chlorothiazide andother thiazide analogues in diabetes insipidusresults in a striking reduction in urinary volumewith increase in urinary osmolality.  this curiousantidiuretic action was first described bycrawford & kennedy (1959), and though it hassince been widely confirmed in both the pituitaryand nephrogenic forms of the disease, its precisemechanism remains obscure.  a number ofinvestigators have sought to explain the phenom-enon entirely on the basis of the renal actions ofthese drugs (earley & orloff 1962, goodman &carter 1962), whilst others have contended thatabatement of polyuria may be secondary to acentral effect of the thiazides in decreasing thirst(robson & lambie 1962, skadhauge 1963).over the past two years, we have conducteddetailed in-patient studies of the action ofvarious diuretic drugs of the thiazide and otherseries in a group of 7 patients with pituitarydiabetes insipidus.

the use and mode of action of ethacrynic acidin nephrogenic diabetes insipidusthe use of diuretic agents in the treatmentof nephrogenic diabetes insipidus had been re-ported to result in decreased urine volumeand decreased clearance of free water.  astudy of the use of ethacrynic acid, a potentsaluretic agent, was instituted in patientswith nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in anattempt to achieve a significant antidiureticresponse while allowing a liberal sodium diet.intravenous ethacrynic acid resulted in de-creased urine volume, decreased clearance offree water and decreased rpf and gfr.prolonged oral administration of ethacrynicacid promoted a significant antidiuretic re-sponse when the daily sodium intake waslimited to 60 meq.  the effect of ethacrynicacid on renal function, potassium and chlo-ride excretion, and uric acid metabolism arediscussed.

extrarenal fibromuscular hyperplasia.clinical, radiologic, and pathologic studies on19 patients with lesions in the extrarenal arteries thatresembled fibromuscular hyperplasia are described.in 11 patients fibromuscular hyperplasia was presentin the renal arteries.  patients with involvement of theceliac artery were the only ones who had symptoms ofvisceral ischemia.  fibromuscular hyperplasia of theinternal carotid arteries was observed in 6 patients, 2of whom had symptoms of cerebral ischemia.  nine patientswith fibromuscular hyperplasia of the carotid orrenal arteries had intracranial aneurysms, and in 2others intracranial hemorrhage developed in the absenceof demonstrable aneurysms.  the histologic similaritiesbetween intracranial aneurysms and othertypes of aneurysms that appear in patients with fibromuscularhyperplasia, the frequency of intracranialaneurysms in patients with extracranial fibromuscularhyperplasia, and the similar sex and age incidence suggesta common etiologic origin.

2469. the nature of collagen disease, particularly of systemic lupuserythematosus (sle), with special reference to renal lesions (japanese)from the results of examination of 161 autopsy cases of collagen diseases,rheumatic fever and polyarteritis nodosa (pn) are considered as diseases ofhyperergic nature, showing pronounced specific manifestation in particularorgans.  as the reactivity becomes lower, this specific localization becomesless significant and many organs become affected in sle.  it may accordingly besupposed that sle is not a disease of hypersensitivity but one occurring ina state of exhaustion of reactability after prolonged sensitization.  moreover,a sle-like syndrome arises not only in the end stage of parasepsis, nephritis,nephrosis and some cases of prolonged sensitization by myco.tb but also inpn,pss,dm and rheumatism.  it may therefore be conceivable that sle isa syndrome rather than a separate entity.  it is most important to considerwhether sle-like symptomatology may be regarded as a process equal toan auto-immunization and whether the key to morphological elucidation of theauto-immune phenomenon may lie hidden in this problem.

3535. electron microscopic study of six cases of human renal amyloidosisthis study is particularly concernedwith  (a) the basal membrane in the differentstages; and (b) the intercapillary spacesin the early stages.  the conclusions maybe put as follows  (1) the amyloid substanceseems to have a fibrillar structurefrom the start.  (2) when the walls of theperipheral capillary loops are thickenedby voluminous amyloid deposits, thehyaline aspect of the primitive basal membranepersists, but its structure is altered bythe presence of multiple amyloid fibrils.(3) on the other hand, in the initial stages,amyloid fibrils cannot be seen in the'lamina densa' of the basal membrane; theyonly appear on the epithelial and endo-thelial surfaces of the membrane.  this suggeststhat amyloidosis represents anabnormal precipitate of extrinsic origin, ratherthan a transformation 'in situ'of the basal membrane.  (4) in the very early stagesof amyloid infiltration into theglomeruli the fibrillar substance is found first inthe intercapillary spaces, onlylater does it reach the peripheral capillary walls.

studies on the sweat in renal diabetes insipidus duringtreatment with saluretics.description of a 5-month-old boy sufferingfrom familial diabetes insipidus.  hissweat as well as that of his mother had anincreased nacl content.  chlorthalidoneand fursemide had a different effect bothon the quantity and on the nacl content ofthe sweat.  a single dose of chlorthalidonedecreased the nacl content for a shorttime, but increased the quantity of sweatduring 3 days.  fursemide given intermittentlyproduced a decrease of the sweat naclalso during the intervals and an increaseof the quantity of sweat; however, as acontraregulation during the intervals, thequantity of sweat decreased and at the sametime the urea content increased.  fromthe isotonic serum filtrate in the sweatglands ho and nacl were reabsorbed inthe ducts and the urea concentrationincreased but the reabsorption of ho and nacldid not go parallel, therefore the sweat ishypotonic.  this regulation is altered indiabetes insipidus, therefore the high valuesof nacl.  without changing the osmolarity,na is exchanged with k.  this mechanismis accentuated if the na-concentrationis high.

influence of the adrenal glands on dna synthesis in normaland compensating kidneys.the role of the adrenal glands in controllingthe synthesis of dna in normal andcompensating kidneys of rats given salinedrinking fluid was studied using tritiated-thymidineand radioautography.  adrenalectomyalone increased significantly thelabeling of the renal cortex and medulla ofotherwise intact rats.  two days followingunilateral nephrectomy of rats with intactadrenal glands, the number of labelednuclei in the remaining kidney increased byfactors of about 4 and 2.5 in the cortexand the medulla, respectively.  adrenalectomymoderately decreased the hyper-plasticresponse of the cortex of the remainingkidney, but increased still furtherthe labeling index of the medulla.  by 5 daysafter unilateral nephrectomy of ratswith intact adrenal glands, neither the cortexnor the medulla of the remaining kidneyexhibited a marked hyperplastic response.in adrenalectomized animals, also,unilateral nephrectomy caused only slightincreases in the labeling indices of thecortex and the medulla of the remaining kidney.

the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on water intakeand plasma osmolality in diabetes insipidus inthe rata fall in plasma osmolality accompanied the reduction of urine volume inrats with hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, given hydrochlorothiazide and anotherwise normal diet.  the plasma concentration was not reduced with ahigh sodium intake, although urine volume still fell.  normal rats and hypo-thalamic obese rats increased their water turnover after hydrochlorothiazide,yet their plasma concentration fell.  moreover the antidiuretic response tovasopressin, which is purely renal, was also accompanied by plasma dilution;although it is self-evident that rats which drink less are less thirsty, thereduction in thirst after hydrochlorothiazide may not be a direct result of thechange in plasma osmolality.as previously shown in patients (kennedy and hill, 1963) a high sodiumintake increased free water clearance in diabetes insipidus but did notinterfere with the reduction of polyuria by hydrochlorothiazide, whereas a highpotassium intake reduced free water clearance and prevented any effect of thedrug on urine volume.

the effect of actinomycin d on parathyroid-inducedchange in bone and kidney.actinomycin d (amd), an antibiotic known toinhibit dna-directed rna synthesis,was used to study parathyroid-induced changesin ca mobilization in vivo and in vitroas well as renal excretion of ca and phosphatein rats.  intact and parathyroidectomizedrats subjected to peritoneal lavage wereadministered amd, and changes inca, p, and mg in lavage and serum wereexamined.  amd consistently lowered theca transfer into the peritoneal rinse in boththe intact and parathyroidectomized animals,although the drop in ca was more acuteif the animals were pretreated by subcutaneousinjections of amd than if amd wasadministered as a component of therinse.  pretreatment of lavaged animals withamd prevented the expected increasein osteoclast numbers in the distal metaphysisof the femur but had no effect if administeredas a component of the peritoneal rinse.the incubation of femora removedfrom both intact and parathyroidectomizedanimals resulted in media ca levels thatwere significantly lower after 4 hr. incubationwhen amd was added in vitro.  however,transfer of recently injected ca intothe incubation medium from animalstreated with amd was increased.  in addition,parathyroidectomy of animals subsequentto administration of amd still resultedin expected changes in ca and p in theurine although amd significantly increased pexcretion in both intact and parathyroidectomizedanimals.  it was concluded thatendogenous parathyroid hormone requiresthe continuous production of enzymes ultimatelyresponsible for its action on boneand kidney, but that this action is not necessarilyrelated directly to the productionof m-rna.

cellular proliferation and deoxyribonucleic acidsynthesis in compensating kidneys of miceand the effect of food and waterrestrictioncompensatory enlargement of the kid-ney occurred after unilateral nephrectomyin mice.  fourteen days after the removal ofone kidney the surviving renal tissue                                  6weighed 23 per cent more than single kid-neys from sham-operated animals.  thehyperplastic response of the cortex on thesecond postoperative day was 8 timesgreater than that seen in the same zone ofkidneys from sham-operated animals.  by10 days after surgery the mitotic index ofthe cortex returned to control values.  theouter medulla also underwent hyperplasiabut only on the second day followingunilateral nephrectomy was the increasesignificant.  an increase in mitotic activitywas found in the inner medulla of survivingkidneys, but it was not statistically signifi-cant.both starvation for 48 hours and waterrestriction for 60 hours prevented the hyper-plastic responses in the remaining kidneys2 days after unilateral nephrectomy.  whenwater was given 48 hours after unilateralnephrectomy (after 60 hours of waterrestriction) significant increases in mitoticactivity were noted in the cortex of remain-ing kidneys on the fourth and fifth post-operative days.  however, even after freeaccess to food was allowed (after 48 hourswithout food) no significant increase inmitotic frequency of the remaining kidneywas found.deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in con-trol kidneys of mice was highest in the cor-tex and lowest in the inner medulla asrevealed by radioautographic studies fol-lowing the injection of tritiated thymidine.two days following removal of one kidneythe labeling index of the cortex of remainingkidneys increased 3-fold.  no statisticallysignificant increases of deoxyribonucleicacid synthesis were noted in either the outeror inner medullary regions of the remainingkidneys.

1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renalhomotransplantationdammin g. j.a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs hasbeen completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants.over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed.increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questionsregarding the status treated host.  the current drug protocol of azathioprineand diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50%100-day survivors.  the following observations have been documented  allanimals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapycan be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneysapparently are protected in some way in the new environment because asecond donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantationof a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decreasein renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted backto their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party,non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for theprolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a doubledose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption ormetabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results becausetwo kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in thesame drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient andthis sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned fromdrugs.  additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidneyhomografts reveal the following  skin homografts are universally rejectedwithin 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidneyhomografts sometimes permanently.  when skin and kidney homografts from thesame donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidneysurvival is shortened.  this paradoxical effect probably is explained by theproduction of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney.additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female,are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalizedimmunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.

the role of aldosterone and vasopressin in the posturalchanges in renal excretion in normal subjectsand patients with idiopathic edemathe effects of the upright posture(leisurely walking for 2 hours) on half-hourly urine volume, and excretion ofsodium and creatinine were studied in13 normal subjects and 13 patients withidiopathic edema, while they drank 150or 300 ml. of 0.14 per cent sodiumchloride solution every half hour.  whenthe 2 hours of walking were comparedwith a preceding recumbent period of4 hours, both groups were found to showa significant antidiuresis upright.  theadministration of ethanol during the lasthalf hour of recumbency abolished thefall in urine flow and in free water clear-ance during the first hour of walking inthe normal subjects and significantly re-duced this fall in the patients withedema.  sodium excretion in the normalsubjects was slightly but not significantlylower when upright than when recum-bent, but in the edematous patients wassignificantly lower when upright and fellprogressively over the 2 hour period.  ad-ministration of spironolactone or d-amphetamine increased sodium excretionduring recumbency in both groups butincreased sodium excretion upright onlyin the edematous patients to equal thatof the normal subjects.  creatinine excre-tion was not changed in either group byposture or drug therapy.  similar studieswere performed on 5 patients with un-treated diabetes insipidus and on 6 pa-tients with adrenal insufficiency treatedwith hydrocortisone alone.  lack of al-dosterone (in adrenal insufficiency) didnot increase the amount of sodium ex-creted above that of normal subjects inrecumbency and did not prevent the oc-currence of significant sodium retentionin the upright posture.  however, lackof adh (in diabetes insipidus) delayedthe antidiuresis upright for 30 minutes.the results indicate that adh releaseis probably responsible for the reductionin urine volume during the first 30 min-utes after assuming the upright posture,but not thereafter.  the excessive magni-tude of the orthostatic antidiuresis inidiopathic edema probably results froma cause other than adh release, since itis not completely overcome by ethanol.reduced na excretion during 2 hours inthe upright posture can occur in theabsence of circulating aldosterone, butthe abnormal magnitude of the na re-tention in the patients with idiopathicedema probably results from hyperal-dosteronism.
