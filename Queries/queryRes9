3194. systemic hypothermia via gastric coolingeight dogs underwent gastric cooling forsystemic hypothermia.  each dog was cooledwith the balloon filled with a 'safe' volumebased on weight (20 ml/kg) and subjectedto cooling with the balloon filled maximally,but safely to a pressure of 10 mm hg.consistently, the latter procedure was farmore efficient, averaging 2.6 times asrapid for all degrees of hypothermia.  adecrease in core temperature by 7 c re-quired an average of only 28.4 minutes.on comparison with clinical reports of hy-pothermia induced by the usual gastriccooling, an improved efficiency of two-foldto three-fold is still noted.

3270. tolerance of dogs to deep hypothermia.  controlled and maintained with apump oxygenatorthe advantages of hypothermia of below 10 c for 2 hr,induced and maintained byextracorporeal circulation of 200 min.,were compared to partial bypass of thesame duration during normothermia.in the normothermic group 9 dogs out of 12lived.  in the hypothermic group 6 dogsout of 15 (40%) survived when perfused atthe high flow of 55 cc/kg/min.  elevendogs out of 15 (70%) survived when the flowrate was reduced to 25 cc/kg/min whenthe temperature was below 10 c.  the deathin the high flow group were due mainlyto postperfusion lung changes even when lowpulmonary venous pressure was assuredby venting in the left atrial chamber.  me-tabolic acidosis occurred in all groups;though greater in the high flow, with thelow flow intermediate between the formerand the normothermic group.  this changeto a great degree, can be explained by the lung changes.

reaction of the adrenal cortex during controlled experimentalhypothermia .the stress reaction caused by hypothermia was studied in rabbitssubjected to controlled hypothermia by immersion in an icebath . some ofthe animals were re-warmed . to anesthetize the animals, pentobarbitonesodium (nembutal) was given intraperitoneally, and, in some cases,followed by ether anesthesia . further, the stress reaction produced bypentobarbitone alone was studied in five animals, and that of etheranesthesia alone in three . no anesthesia was given to the three rabbitsplaced in the refrigerator . the variation in distribution and amount ofadrenocortical lipids served as an indicator for evaluation of thestress reaction .in all the hypothermia tests there occurred changes in thedistribution and amount of cortical lipids, denoting a stress reactionbrought about by hypothermia . in rabbits, the barbiturate did not seemto inhibit the stress reaction . this may be attributed partly to thetest animal, as such and partly to the fact that shivering of someextent always occurred during the hypothermia experiments .

studies in perfusion hypothermia with special reference to /deephypothermia/ and circulatory arrest .1. perfusion hypothermia produces large temperature gradients withinthe body since organs are cooled roughly in proportion to their basalblood flows . the difference between the coldest and the warmest portionof the body after 30 minutes of perfusion exceeds 25 c .2. the average body temperature, which provides a proper measure oftotal body cooling, may be calculated from the arteriovenous temperaturedifference and the extracorporeal flow rate .3. true /deep/ hypothermia is not obtainable by reasonable periods ofperfusion alone .4. an important rise of core temperatures occurs during circulatoryarrest in hypothermia because of relatively high average bodytemperature .5. high average body temperatures lead to continuing production oflactic acid in muscle tissue, whereas low core temperatures impairlactic acid metabolism . thus metabolic acidosis is progressive inprolonged perfusion hypothermia, and is accentuated by total circulatoryarrest . progressive acidosis may be minimized by uniform profoundcooling by combining external with perfusion hypothermia .6 diluents appear to have little effect on total body heat exchangeduring perfusion cooling .7. perfusion warming has a differentially greater effect on coreorgans . though these are readily brought to a normal range, much of theanimal may remain cold .

current status of hypothermia .moderate hypothermia has been recommended for many and variedconditions . today its value is being questioned in the light ofcontrolled groups of patients . at the moment its use is justified incertain cardiac and other operations where circulation may beinterrupted for short periods.. in general surgical procedures wheremassive, sudden blood loss may be anticipated.. in neurosurgicaloperations where a /relaxed/ brain is required.. following acute hypoxiasuch as seen in cardiac arrest.. and perhaps in the therapy of acutesepticemic shock .profound hypothermia in association with extracorporeal circulationrests on shakier premises, but can be of value in major cardiacoperations where asystole is required and in certain neurosurgicalprocedures where complete interruption of circulation is indicated .there is a great hazard in the development of inadvertent orunrecognized hypothermia in the anesthetized patient . monitoring ofbody temperature is an important feature of the care of the patient inthe operating theater and in the recovery room .

4088. the use of hypothermia and dehydration in the treatment of severecerebral hypoxiathe rational for using hypothermia orcerebral dehydration is to suppress or re-verse progressive or delayed cerebraldamage after hypoxia.  it is suggested thatdamage of this nature results from injuryto the astroglia and oligodendroglia,especially the former.  experimental andclinical evidence favors lowering of thebody temperature immediately after anyepisode of hypoxia accompanied by impor-tant damage to the brain.  the rationalfor using dehydration is insecure and itsresults are uncertain.  this treatmentshould probably be reserved for cases inwhich a raised cerebrospinal fluid pressurehas been proved, and in which othermeasures, especially hypothermia,are either not available or have failed.

surgical treatment of atrial septal defect under hypothermia .the technique of inflow occlusion under 30 c. hypothermia was adoptedfor direct visual correction in 133 consecutive cases of atrial septaldefect of the secundum variety and the associated anomalies .the use of extracorporeal circulation combined with hypothermia wasreserved for the repair of two cases of ostium primum defects .the over-all operative mortality was 4 .post-operative evaluation showed that the results have been good inalmost all patients, including those with pulmonary hypertension .since an ostium primum defect requires cardio-pulmonary bypass for itsclosure, the pre-operative recognition of the defect is highly desirablein the selection of patients for operation and in planning the procedureitself .the information derived from the clinical examination and appropriatediagnostic studies has been found to be consistently accurate in thepre-operative differentiation of the primum from the secundum defect .therefore, the unexpected discovery of a primum defect at operation wasnot a problem .in our experience, open-heart surgery under 30 c. hypothermia for therepair of an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and theassociated anomalies is a safe and practical technique and effectivelycorrects the anomaly with minimal risk .

1139. optimal coronary flow in the bypassed normothermic and hypothermic hearta series of experiments were conducted in dogsin which bypass flow, temperature,and direct coronary perfusion pressure were varied.coronary flow, coronary ven-ous saturation, myocardial oxygen consumption (mvo2),and coronary vascular re-sistance were assayed.  coronary flow as a percentageof total bypass flow did notvary appreciably at varying levels of bypass flow.induction of hypothermia, whentotal bypass flow is constant, results in decreasingcoronary flow.  induction of hy-pothermia when maintaining a constant bypass pressureresults in an increasingcoronary flow with temperatures down to 22 c.further cooling causes a reductionin flow.  using isolated coronary perfusion at 100 mm. hg,coronary flow fell andresistance rose during the first 15 min. of bypass.using isolated coronary perfu-sion at 100 mm. hg, induction of moderate hypothermia(25 c.) caused an increasein coronary flow and venous saturation and a decreasein cardiovascular resistanceand mvo2.  under the same conditions, induction ofhypothermia to 18 c. producedsimilar changes but caused myocardial hemorrhageand ventricular fibrillation.  pro-found hypothermia probably leads to excessivefragility of the capillary bed.  reduc-tion of perfusion pressure to 50 mm. hg at nearnormothermia reduced coronaryflow and slightly reduced venous saturationand mvo2.  the same reduction of perfu-sion pressure at 18 c. produced similar butless marked changes.  reduction to 25mm. hg at 18 c. markedly reduced coronary flow,venous saturation, and mvo2initially, but with partial recovery later.  from thisdata of acute experiments indogs, coronary perfusion using moderate hypothermia(about 31 c.) and 50 mm.hg, slightly pulsatile mean pressure appears optimal.

1361. the mechanism of histidase induction and formation in bacillus subtilisthe role of the inducer, l-histidine, in thesynthesis of histidase (l-histidine am-monia lyase) in b. subtilis was investigated.it was found that induced cells poisonedwith actinomycin, an inhibitor of rna synthesis,lose their capacity for the forma-tion of a protein precursor of histidase at a ratewhich is independent of the presenceor absence of the inducer.  these results showthat the inducer does not increasethe intracellular level of histidase-specificmessenger rna by preventing the des-truction of the major portion of this material,the fraction that is engaged in pro-tein synthesis.  the possibility has not beenexcluded that the inducer exerts itseffect by bringing about the stabilization ofthe messenger rna that is still attachedto dna or has not yet become attached toribosomes.  alternatively, the inducer mayactually stimulate the synthesis ofhistidase-specific messenger rna.  the conver-sion of the precursor to active enzymeappears to involve polymerization of mono-mers, rather than the release ofribosome-bound inactive enzyme.

2406. profound hypothermiathe aim of hypothermia is protection of vitalcerebral structures from hypoxiaduring aneurysm repair; profound hypothermiais also valuable in operating oncertain cardiac defects which cannot be repairedeven with whole body perfusion.since the time needed for aneurysm repair oftenexceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12minutes without circulation afforded by surfacehypothermia of 29  to 30  c., theauthors have investigated the drew (open-chest)technic, the closed-chest method,and isolated cerebral perfusion.  the drew technicconsists of substituting twopumps for the heart while the patient's lungs actas the oxygenator.  because of itsdisadvantages (the large amounts of blood neededand the morbidity due to intra-cardiac cannulation and median sternotomy), aclosed-chest method was developed,using a mayo-gibbons vertical-sheet pump-oxygenatorto provide the perfusion andextracorporeal cooling without requiring thoracotomy.in cerebral perfusion, bloodis taken from one artery, pumped through a heatexchanger, and returned to anotherartery.  the authors describe anesthetic technics,offer comparisons of the threemethods, give instructions pertaining to the productionof hypothermia, and list theproblems encountered in the management of these cases.

946. respiration in hypothermia.  i. respiratory pattern andacid-base balance in the bloodmongrel dogs, under light pentobarbital anesthesia,were made hypothermic by im-mersing them in ice water and then normothermicin warm water.  in the course ofcooling, the respiratory rate and pulmonaryventilation, after an initial increase,were reduced as the rectal temperature fell,and spontaneous respiration was ar-rested at rectal temperatures of 21-25 c.alveolar pco2 was increased, after aninitial slight lowering, with the progress ofhypothermia.  arterial ph and standardbicarbonate (jorgensen and astrup) decreased,and the alkalinity of the blood coh/ch (winterstein) decreased markedly during hypothermia.these findings suggestboth respiratory and metabolic acidosis as themechanisms concerned.  in the courseof rewarming all these changes disappeared rapidlyand completely though the venti-latory stimulation observed as an initial transitoryphenomenon during cooling failed to occur.

further observations of the lymphomasof african childrenduring 1963, cytopathogenic, filtrable agents were frequently encountered incultures of embryonic human kidney cells following their inoculation withsupernatant fluids from primary human amnion cultures which had previously beenexposed to extracts of tumors and other specimens from east african childrenwith malignant lymphomas of the kind described by burkitt and others.  theresults seemed noteworthy because they suggested an intimate associationbetween the agents and the disease, and also because of the nature of theisolations which involved two phenomena, an initial induction of a peculiarspindling and twisting of the amnion cells(fig. 1) and subsequently destructive changesin kidney cells inoculated with fluid from such altered amnion cultures.  thedirect inoculation of embryonic kidney cells with extracts of tumors or bonemarrow never caused cytopathogenic effects nor did the isolated, transmissibleagents have the capacity to induce the amnion lesions.  nevertheless,the two effects were closely associated and clearly related to the specimens.the cytopathogenic agents were later cultivated on protein-rich media andfound to have the characteristics of mycoplasma.  they failed to inducetumors in a variety of animals, and serologic tests in which they served asantigen gave suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a relationship to thedisease.  the mycoplasma also failed to induce the amnion lesions caused bythe specimens.

948.cardiac activity in cranio-cerebral hypothermiathe onset of hypothermia rarely alters the heartrate.  as it deepens to 35-32, therate slows, and at the level of 30-29 it usuallyamounts to only half its original va-lue.  at 28 or below, the development ofbradycardia is observed.  after warmingto 32 the normal heart rate is restored.during operations on the abdominal organsthe heart rate is only slightly modified.the appearance of solitary extrasystoles israre and is usually associated with stimulationof the diaphragm.  the most markedchanges in the heart rate are observed during operations on the heart,especially ifit is excluded from the circulation.  anidioventricular rhythm may develop beforethe heart stops beating.  after removal of theligatures from the venae cavae the nor-mal rhythm is restored.  as the temperaturefalls, the excitability of the myocardiumincreases.  conduction is more resistant.areflexia continues even during direct sti-mulation of reflexogenic zones.  in the surgicalstage of cranio-cerebral hypothermiait is clear that no significant degree of energyor hemodynamic insufficiency deve-lops, whether in experimental conditions orduring operations on patients.  at opera-tion a well-marked stabilization of the contractilepower of the myocardium may be observed.

2302. the carcinogenic activities of n-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene and itsmetal chelates as a function of retention at the injection sitethe carcinogenic activities of s.c. administeredn-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene(n-hydroxy-aaf) and a variety of its metal chelates indicate that greateractivity locally is associated with a longer retention of the chelates at thesite of injection with a slow release of n-hydroxy-aaf to the surroundingtissue.  no tumors were obtained at the sites of 4 injections of n-hydroxy-aaf(3.2 mg. /injection), but 4 and 16 of 20 rats developed sarcomas at thesites of 8 and 16 injections, respectively.  the nickelous, cobaltous, ferric,or cupric chelates induced moderate to high incidences of sarcomas with 1 or 4injections; in these cases one-half of the administered n-hydroxy-aaf wasretained at the injection site for 4-50 days.  the manganous and zinc chelatesand the potassium salt were less active at the injection site; thehalf-retention times for these ranged from 2.5 hr. to 2.5 days.  the comparablehalf-retention time for n-hydroxy-aaf was about 2 hr.  injection of the metalderivatives s. c. with short half-retention times resulted in higher incidencesof mammary tumors than injection of the derivatives with half-retentiontimes of 4 or more days.  when administered in the food the cupric chelateof n-hydroxy-aaf induced the same spectrum of tumors as n-hydroxy-aaf,but the incidences were lower.  while the prolonged retention of the materialat the injection site may account for the greater carcinogenic activities ofthe metal chelates, serious consideration must also be given to the possibleimportance of chelation of carcinogens or their metabolites to cellularconstituents.

effect of parathyroidectomy and ferric dextrinupon calciphylactic sensitization by uremiaexperiments on the rat indicate that calciphy-lactic sensitization can be achieved by bilateralnephrectomy.  intravenous administration of aferric dextrin preparation (fe-din) inducesselective calcification in the buccal mucosa,esophagus, trachea and mediastinum of thenephrectomized rat although it produces no suchchanges in intact control animals.  conversely,fe-din prevents the cardiovascular calcificationnormally elicited by nephrectomy.  parathy-roidectomy protects the nephrectomized ratagainst the fe-din-induced calciphylaxis.hence, it may be concluded that: 1) autologousparathyroid hormone, in amounts secreted bythe glands, can act as a calciphylactic sensitizerand 2) fe-din is highly effective in protecting thecardiovascular system against uremic damage.

experiments on the contribution of somatotrophin to prenatal growth in the rathypophyseoprivus in a fetal rat induced by decapitating the fetus in uteroretards fetal growth.  this effect can be prevented by injected somatotrophin.these observations substantially support the view that in the normal ratshortly before birth the fetal somatotrophin from the developing hypophysisgoverns in part the prenatal growth which occurs at that time.  althoughcomplete hypophysectomy of a pregnant rat retardsthe growth of fetuses, the mannerof its action is obscure.  in an individual litter, combined hypophysectomyof the mother and hypophyseoprivus in a fetus retards fetal growth but notto any greater extent than hypophysectomy of the mother withouthypophyseoprivus in the fetus.  in the intact fetus injections of somatotrophin(armour) do not accelerate fetal growth, presumably because ample fetalsomatotrophin from the developing hypophysis is present.

parathyroid extract-induced changes in the oxidation of citrate,succinate and other organic acids by liver.parathyroid extract (pte) or partiallypurified parathyroid hormone administered invivo markedly altered the oxidationin vitro by rabbit liver minces of citrate, -ketoglutarate-c, succinate-c, fumarate-cand lactate.  with ca ++ present in theincubation medium, minces from ptetreated animals produced more co and hada greater o consumption than did controlminces.  this stimulation was due, in partat least, to a more rapid decline in metabolicactivity of the control tissues.  whenca++ was absent, total metabolism wasincreased and the tissue derived from ptetreated animals was less active than thecontrol tissue.  the effect was detected asearly as 4 hr after injection (750 u/kg)and could be elicited with as little as 200 u(at 14 hr).  the action of pte could notbe duplicated by the injection of cacl intothe animal.  the data suggest that one effectof treatment was a general inhibition ofoxidation.  the stimulation of metabolismcould be a consequence of this inhibitionor a separate unrelated alteration.

2803. effect of dosage on endotoxin-induced changes in the reticuloendothelialsystem of rabbitstissues were removed from rabbits 4and 24 hr. following an i.v. injection of 5,25, or 200 ug of endotoxin.  explants oftissues from normal and injected animalswere grown in a coagulated plasma mediumand in medium containing 1 ug/ml ofendotoxin.  the migration and growth of cellswere observed during the following weekof incubation.  the inhibition or stimulationof cells of the reticuloendothelial system(res) at different host sites after endotoxinadministration depended on the dosageand on the known capacity of different organsto take up circulating endotoxin.  macro-phage migration was suppressed in culturesof spleen removed 4 hr. after a dose ofhibited by 200 ug, but macrophages inlymph node, testis, and thymus showed an in-crease in numbers, in extent of migrationand in phagocytic activity.  widespreadres stimulation was seen in tissues removed24 hr after the largest dose.  in ad-dition to the restoration of re cell activity inspleen and lung there was a markedincrease in the migration of large phagocyticcells from bone marrow, as well asother organs.  macrophages from endotoxin-injectedanimals were as sensitive asnormal macrophages to added endotoxin in vitro.

relationships of growth hormone, steroids and relaxin in thetransformation of pubic joint cartilage to ligament inhypophysectomized micethe histological changes occurringin the pubic joint of hormonallytreated intact or hypophysectomized micehave been studied.  estrogen treatment resultedin bone resorption and transformationof the cartilage caps of the pubic bones tofibrocartilage in intact mice but not in hypophysectomizedmice.  furthermore, relaxinfailed to influence the appearance of the pubicjoint of estrogen-primed hypophysectomizedmice, whereas it induced the development oflong interpubic ligaments in intact mice.when growth hormone (sth) was administeredto hypophysectomized mice, the pubicjoints responded to estrogen with bone resorptionand transformation of the cartilage capsto fibrocartilage.  sth treatment also restoredthe ability of the pubic joint of hypophysectomizedmice to proliferate long interpubic ligamentswhen estrogen and relaxin were administered.progesterone specifically inhibitedligament formation due to relaxin injectionwithout altering the histological changesassociated with estrogen treatment, both inintact mice and in sth-maintained, hypophysectomized mice.

investigations into the thiazide-induced antidiuresis inpatients with diabetes insipidusplasma sodium, osmolality and serumchloride, together with creatinine clear-ance, were studied before and duringthiazide treatment of 7 patients withdiabetes insipidus.the diuresis was reduced by 28-39%.the urine osmolality was increased by7-128%.  an average decrease in plasmasodium of 4 meq/i, in plasma osmolalityof 21 mosm/kg, and in serum chloride of8 meq/i was observed.  only in one pa-tient was the creatinine clearance re-duced significantly.  the thirst-feeling wasreduced even from the first day of treat-ment.  the diuresis was not minimal untilthe third to fourth day.  if the diuresis wascorrected for the extra electrolyte ex-cretion initiated by the thiazide, theantidiuresis was found to be operating tothe full extent even on the first day oftreatment.it is concluded that the antidiuresis ismainly secondary to the natriuresis and toa certain degree due to a decreased thirst-feeling; but there seems also to be a directrenal action, involving at least a reduc-tion of the glomerular filtration rate.  apronounced antidiuresis was found by awater deprivation test after thiazidetreatment in one patient.

studies in sickle cell anemia xxi. clinico-pathological aspects ofneurological manifestations .neurologic manifestations are frequent in patients who have sicklecell disease . these manifestations may be the earliest presenting signsand symptoms and they are so variable that the patient may beerroneously diagnosed as having conditions such as meningitis,poliomyelitis, subdural hematoma, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage,lead encephalitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, and congenitalmalformations of the brain . furthermore, development of thesemanifestations cannot be predicted on the basis of the type of crisisinvolved .prognosis following neurological involvement is unpredictable, butrecurrent episodes, together with abnormal electroencephalographicreadings suggest a poor outcome . such patients die or are the victimsof rather severe neurological deficits .neurological examination of these patients suggests diffuseinvolvement of the cerebral hemispheres . examination of thepathological material, however, often fails to reveal thromboses . thestriking findings are infarcts in the white matter and perivascularhemorrhages .the thesis that the abnormal neurological findings in these patientsare actually due to sickle cell disease is supported by the fact thatall such symptoms appear in association with clinical circumstancesknown to induce sickling . these include surgery and anesthesia, feverand infection .

the effect of human growth hormone inhypopituitary dwarfismhuman growth hormone (hgh) raben has beenused in a dosage of 2 mg./m.2/day or 5 mg./m.2 twiceweekly.  this dosage is probably in or below, butcertainly not above, the range of physiologicalreplacement therapy.in a standardized five-day metabolic hgh testhypopituitary dwarfs retain more n than childrenwithout gh deficiency.  this test is valuablediagnostic help in hypopituitary dwarfism.a prolonged treatment with hgh acceleratesgrowth in hypopituitary dwarfs but not in childrenwithout gh deficiency.  growth rate, induced bythis treatment, is first above average and later averageor below average for age.  this decreasing responseto hgh is typical for the general phenomenon ofcatch-up growth and is not caused by the develop-ment of antibodies.of 9 hypopituitary dwarfs, treated for at least 9months, 3 were growth resistant from the beginningin spite of a high n retention in the preceding hghtest.  this resistance is caused by the developmentof high titres of specific hgh antibodies in the veryfirst few months of treatment.  these antibodiessuppress the effect of hgh both on metabolism andon growth.  the unexpected occasional induction inman of antibodies against a homologous proteinhormone is of great interest.  the possibility thatthese antibodies might be active not only against thehomogenous but also against the endogenous hormonecould have a far-reaching biological importance.

experimental studies on cerebrospinalfluid flowa mixed suspension of kaolin and lyco-podium was injected into the cisterna magnaof dogs.  blockade of csf space was producedsuccessfully in 63 of 75 dogs; in 48 of the 63,ventricular dilatation of more than interme-diate degree was observed.in these hydrocephalic dogs experimentalshunting was performed either between thelateral ventricle and the lumbar cistern or be-tween the unilateral lateral ventricle and thecontralateral cerebral subarachnoid space.  uni-directional, steady csf flow averaged 0.15 ml. perhour in the cases of the former shunting,and the flow averaged 0.25 ml. per hour in thecases of the latter shunting.csf flow rate from the ventricle toward thecerebral subarachnoid space was larger whenintraventricular pressure was higher.  this in-crease in flow rate parallel to increasing pres-sure probably results from an increase in csfabsorption.  there seems to be an upper limitof the flow rate as the pressure is raised.transient reflux of csf flow was induced byjugular or abdominal compression.following intravenous administration of hy-pertonic solutions, csf flow rate decreasedparallel to the fall of csf pressure and re-gained the original value as the pressure wasrecovered.  when the pressure fell as low as50 mm. of water the flow almost stopped.

hypopituitarism: a study of growthhormone and other endocrine functions.pituitary function was evaluated in 25 adults withevidence of hypopituitarism or enlargement of the sellaturcica.  growth hormone secretory function was measuredby radioimmunoassay of plasma samples takenbefore and after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in a standardizedtest of growth hormone reserve.  all patientsexhibited significant defects in growth hormone secretion,as indicated by the failure of this hormone to riseto normal levels in response to hypoglycemia.  the orderof frequency of hormonal loss was: growth hormone,gonadotropin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroidstimulating hormone.  no pattern of deficiency was characteristicfor any particular etiology of hypopituitarism.one patient with asymptomatic enlargement of the sellaturcica (accidentally discovered) had an isolated lossof growth hormone secretory capacity.  two patients inthe series demonstrated intrinsic deficiency of thyroidas well as pituitary secretion, and both had elevatedliters of antithyroid antibodies.  this study representsthe first direct evaluation, by radioimmunoassay ofgrowth hormone function in a series of hypopituitaryadults.  it demonstrates a remarkably high prevalenceof growth hormone loss, and suggests that the growthhormone response to hypoglycemia may be one of themost sensitive tests for the diagnosis of hypopituitarism.

etiology of trypan blue induced antenatalhydrocephalus in the albino ratwistar strain albino rats were injected with 1 cm3 of a 1% solutionof trypan blue.  three types of dye were used: matheson, coleman and bell,chroma-gesellschaft and a highly purified sample.  the dyes were injected ondays 6, 7, and 8 of gestation.  fetuses were excised from days 16 through 20,fixed, decalcified where necessary, embedded in paraffin, serially sectionedand stained.  newborn young were treated similarly.  chroma-gesellschafttrypan blue was without reproductive or teratogenic effect at the above doses.increasing the dose did not increase the teratogenicity but did yield adecrease in litter size.  both matheson, coleman and bell trypan blue and thepurified sample were teratogenic.  the most frequent neural defect observedwas hydrocephalus.  serial sections of the newborn hydrocephalics showed anoccluded or extremely tenotic aqueduct of sylvius in 31 of 33 sectionedanimals.  the fetuses collected from days 18 through 20 also had occluded orstenotic aqueducts if hydrocephalic.  aqueductal stenosis or occlusion waspresent in 17-day-old fetuses, but hydrocephalus was not conclusivelydemonstrated at this age.  sixteen-day-old fetuses did not have aqueductalocclusion in any of those examined, but stenosis was evident.  it is concludedthat the defect predisposing to hydrocephalus in the young of trypan bluetreated rats of this strain is aqueductal stenosis or occlusion.

epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) as a therapeutic agent based on 5years clinical experience.experience in the treatment of 744 patients withe-aca suggested that the use of the preparation is indicatedin the following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhagein association with delivery.  (2) acute systemicfibrinolysis in association with surgery.  it ismainly major operations on the thorax, pancreas, prostate,liver and genital organs that are complicated byfibrinolysis, but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur afterany operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis in patientswith cancer, particularly cancer of the prostateand pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicatingvarious disorders, especially leukaemia, livercirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote inthrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activityin the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduceblood losses following prostatectomy, especially if thetreatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopicallyclear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumaticinjury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia andother coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effectivewhether given orally or intravenously.  in stateswith increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity inthe urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day hasproved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug one.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function testswere observed, not even in cases receiving more than1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs ofintravascular coagulation in connection with e-acatherapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications after prostatectomy in patientstreated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.judging from the authors' experience in this materiale-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero andin vitro with rubella virus.a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomeswas undertaken to determine if damageto the genetic apparatus of human cells maybe induced by rubella virus and whethersuch damage produces the pathology seenin newborns from mothers infected earlyin pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains wereinitiated in vitro from embryonic materialobtained by therapeutic abortion of fetusesfrom rubella-infected mothers.  embryonicmaterial from spontaneous and non-rubellatherapeutic abortions yielded similarcell strains for infection in vitro.  theresults from both types of studies were asfollows: (a) virus shedding cell strains wereobtained from all types of organs cultivated,which indicated wide disseminationof virus in the fetuses from rubella-infectedmothers.  (b) chronic infection couldreadily be established by in vitro infectionand no cytopathic effect was noted.(c) although many strains continued to shedvirus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,no changes in growth propertiesoccurred with the exception that infectedstrains from lung tissue showed limitedgrowth capacities.  (d) from observationsof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obviouschromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctionalchanges were observed instrains infected naturally or experimentally.(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derivedcell strains there was a marked elevationin frequency of chromosome breakage in3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlationbetween virus shedding in vitro andincreased chromosome breakage was notedalthough this was not complete.  (g) thecombined average frequency of chromosomebreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortionstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortusstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,but significant elevation in average chromosomebreak frequency (9.8%) was obtainedin four cell strains which had been experimentallyinfected in vitro with rubella virus(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effectsupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,these were restricted to slight general elevationsin frequency of breakage abovenormal values.  very high increases in breakswere sporadic.  it appears more likelythat the general fetal abnormalities associatedwith rubella infection in vivo resultfrom possible effects of the virus upon growthrather than from effects upon thechromosomes.  however, the studies wererestricted to fibroblasts cultured invitro; and effects on other types of cellsmay have greater implications for thisquestion.

hela cells resistant to bromodeoxyuridine and deficient in thymidinekinase activity.mutant sublines of hela s3 cells resistantto growth inhibition by bromodeoxyuridine(budr) have been isolated.  the resistantcell lines (hela bu-10, hela bu-15,hela bu-25, hela bu-50, and hela bu-100)proliferated in the presence of 10,15,25,50, and 100 mg/ml budr, respectively.extracts from hela bu-25, helabu-50, and hela bu-100 cells exhibited2-5% of the thymidine-h, deoxyuridine-h,and bromodeoxyuridine-h phosphorylatingactivities of parental hela s3 cells.hela bu-10 and hela bu-15 cell extractswere also deficient in thymidine kinaseactivity, yielding approx. 43% and 8%,respectively, the thymidine kinase activityof parental hela s3 cells.  the deficiencyin thymidine kinase activity of hela bu-100cells was not due to negative feedback inhibitionby high levels of budr or to interferencewith the thymidine kinase assay byinhibitors or competing enzymes in thehela bu-100 cell extracts.  following 5 weeklypassages in media lacking budr,the hela bu-100 cells did not exhibit increasedthymidine kinase activity.  moreover,mixtures of extracts from hela s3and hela bu-100 cells displayed a thymidinekinase activity equivalent to the sumof the activities or extracts prepared,respectively, from the hela s3 and helabu-100 cells.  radioautographic studieshave shown that after hela s3 cells wereincubated for 6 hr with thymidine-h,35-45% of the nuclei were heavily labeledwith radioactivity.  however, fewer helabu-100 cells displayed labeled nuclei andthe nuclei were only lightly labeled.hela bu-100 cell extracts contained normalamounts of thymidylate synthetase,thymidilate kinase, and uridine kinase activities.following infection by vacciniavirus, high levels of thymidine kinase activitywere induced in hela bu-100 cells.
