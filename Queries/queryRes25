antidiuretic properties of chlorothiazidein diabetes insipidus dogschlorothiazide was found to decreaseurine volume and increase urine con-centration in diabetes insipidus dogs.there was no change in gfr, rpf,tmpah, plasma volume, extracellularfluid or total body water.  the one con-sistent altered function was a decreasein "free water" clearance.  diazoxide andmercuhydrin were not antidiuretic.  it isbelieved that the antidiuretic action isdependent on the chlorothiazide-inducedsaluresis.  although the mechanism ofthis antidiuresis has not been clearly de-fined, it seems best explained by postu-lating a decrease in filtrate reaching thedistal nephron (giving a decreased finalurine volume) coupled with inhibition ofsolute reabsorption in the distal tubule(preventing the selective reabsorption ofsolute in the distal tubule that is nor-mally seen, accounting for the increasein urine concentration).  the possiblerole of the mineralocorticoids in theantidiuretic response to chlorothiazidetherapy was investigated in diabetes in-sipidus and adrenalectomized dogs.  ad-ministration of sodium-retaining steroidsto diabetes insipidus dogs did not re-produce the urinary changes associatedwith chlorothiazide therapy.  in addition,the antidiuretic response to chlorothia-zide was not altered by adrenalectomyor spironolactone administration.  there-fore, the presence of the sodium-retain-ing steroids are not essential for the anti-diuretic response of chlorothiazide indiabetes insipidus.

the action of oral diureticsin diabetes insipiduschronic administration of chlorothiazide andother thiazide analogues in diabetes insipidusresults in a striking reduction in urinary volumewith increase in urinary osmolality.  this curiousantidiuretic action was first described bycrawford & kennedy (1959), and though it hassince been widely confirmed in both the pituitaryand nephrogenic forms of the disease, its precisemechanism remains obscure.  a number ofinvestigators have sought to explain the phenom-enon entirely on the basis of the renal actions ofthese drugs (earley & orloff 1962, goodman &carter 1962), whilst others have contended thatabatement of polyuria may be secondary to acentral effect of the thiazides in decreasing thirst(robson & lambie 1962, skadhauge 1963).over the past two years, we have conducteddetailed in-patient studies of the action ofvarious diuretic drugs of the thiazide and otherseries in a group of 7 patients with pituitarydiabetes insipidus.

nephrogenic diabetes insipiduschlorothiazide has been found of value inestablishing and maintaining adequate hydra-tion in some patients; its exact mechanism ofaction is not known.  the antidiuretic effectsof chlorothiazide and its analogues have beenstudied in six patients with ndi, two ofwhom were infants less than six months ofage.  dehydrated infants showed a dramaticresponse to treatment.  with those unable toachieve an optimal fluid intake prior to treat-ment, the initial beneficial response was asso-ciated with an increased fluid intake.  follow-ing this initial antidiuretic response, a vari-able degree of "escape" or resistance to theaction of the drug commonly occurred.  de-spite the unpredictability of a prolonged anti-diuretic response, a therapeutic trial of chloro-thiazide in ndi seems warranted if diet aloneis not sufficient to maintain hydration.  it mustbe remembered, however, that this drug is po-tentially toxic.

the antidiuretic mechanism of hydrochlorothia-zide in the treatment of diabetes insipidusthe changes in water and electro-lyte balance during hydrochlorothiazidetherapy in 2 patients with vasopressin-deficient diabetes insipidus were studi-ed.  in 1 case, under fixed daily so-dium intake, the urinary sodium excre-tion markedly increased on the first dayof treatment, but the urinary volumebegan to fall on the second day and per-sisted low for 3 days after discontinua-tion of the drug.  in the other case theurinary volume markedly decreasedwhen the daily sodium intake was strict-ly limited.  it further decreased onhydrochlorothiazide therapy but aftersodium intake was restored it returnedto the pretreatment level despite con-tinued use of the drug.the antidiuretic action of hydro-chlorothiazide in the treatment of dia-betes insipidus is believed to be relatedto the sodium depletion state of the bodybrought about by increased output ordecreased intake of sodium.  sodiumand water reabsorption in the proximalconvoluted tubules in the kidney in-creases and the amount of glomerularfiltrate reaching the distal convolutedtubules decreases.  thus the finalurinary volume falls.
