recovery of mycoplasmas in the study ofhuman leukaemia and other malignanciesnumerous reports have been published concerning thenecessity of testing for the presence of mycoplasmas beforethe interpretation of experiments performed in cellcultures.  such tests are especially important whenthe presence of viruses is suspected, since recent evidenceindicates that some mycoplasmas are capable of elicitinga transmissible cytopathic effect.in addition, some mycoplasmas and viruses shareproperties, such as size, filterability, morphology inelectron microscopy, sensitivity to ether, ability tohaemagglutinate and cause haemadsorption, interferencewith virus replication in vitro, lack of inhibition by certaincommonly used antibiotics and inhibition of growth byhomologous antiserum.  thus, the absence of ordinarybacteria and moulds in preparations eliciting a cytopathiceffect in cell cultures is an unreliable criterion for viralidentification.  great caution should be exercised inclassifying new agents as viruses, especially as myxo-viruses, without adequate testing to exclude their identityas mycoplasmas.

isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from adults with respiratoryinfections.isolation of mycoplasma organisms from the sputumwas attempted in 254 patients with various syndromeof respiratory disease.  isolates were obtained in 56% ofthe 197 patients with pneumonia, 50% of patients withchronic bronchial diseases who were not treated withtetracycline, and 33% of persons with acute upper respiratoryinfection.  these differences are not statisticallysignificant and indicate a nonpathogenic role for m.pharyngis and m. salivarium which were the strains mostfrequently isolated.  the highest frequency of isolationwas from males 15 to 30 yr. of age.  isolation of m.pneumoniae requires one to 2 weeks:therefore, it is notuseful for rapid diagnosis.  also, it underestimates theprevalence of infection, especially if patients have receivedtetracycline.  of the serologic tests, complement-fixation(cf) was the most specific.  the growthinhibition test (tri) was the most sensitive and wassignificantly related to atypical pneumonia.  the 2 testsmay measure different antibodies against m. pneumoniae.serum cold agglutinins developed in many casesof pneumonia and were poorly discriminatory in etiologicdiagnosis.  m. pneumoniae infection occurred in aminimum of 8% and a maximum of 20% of civilian patientshospitalized for pneumonia during the season studied.serologic evidence for m. pneumoniae was rare inlobar pneumonia.  in nonlobar pneumonia, m. pneumoniaeaccounted etiologically for 13% to 50% of cases.  the incidenceof m. pneumoniae infection was constant indifferent seasons but greatest relative to the occurrenceof pneumonia in the fall and spring.

serological relationships among human mycoplasmas as shownby complement-fixation and gel diffusionand robert m. chanockantigenic relationships among humanmycoplasmas were studied by complement-fixation and agar gel diffusion techniques.  fourrecognized human species.  mycoplasma hoministype 1, m. hominis type 2, m. salivarium, andm. fermentans were antigenically distinct inthese tests.  in addition, m. pneumoniae (eatonagent, the etiological agent of cold agglutinin-positive atypical pneumonia) was different fromthese four species.  although these species weredistinct, evidence of shared antigenic componentswas obtained in complement-fixation and agargel diffusion tests.  since rabbits were immunizedwith mycoplasmas grown in rabbit muscle infu-sion broth supplemented with rabbit serum or,in the case of m. pneumoniae, with infected chickembryo lung suspension, the possibility that theheterologous reactions resulted from antibodyto growth medium components could be excluded.four recent mycoplasma isolates from the oro-pharynx were analyzed, and three were shown tobe closely related to m. hominis type 1, and thefourth was closely related to m. salivarium.although the recent isolates could not be dis-tinguished from the related "prototype" humanspecies by complement-fixation, differences couldbe detected by the agar gel diffusion technique.

the serological differentiation of mycoplasma strains (pleuro-pneumonia-like organisms) from various sourcesa complement fixation test with rabbit antisera was used to differentiate 82cultures of mycoplasma from man, mammalian cell cultures, laboratory rats andmice, cattle, goats, poultry, embryonated eggs and sewage.seventeen serotypes were distinguished, 5 from man, 1 from mammalian cellcultures, 4 from rats and mice, 4 from cattle and goats, 2 from poultry and onesaprophytic.  most of these corresponded to recognized species of mycoplasma,but 1 of human origin (represented by 1 strain, navel), and 1 from tissuecultures (5 strains), may represent new species.  r38, one of the serotypesfrom rats, could be distinguished from the species m. arthritidis, but isprobably an antigenic variant rather than a distinct species.  two specieshitherto recognized as distinct m. arthritidis and m. hominis type 2, could notbe distinguished and appear to constitute a single species.  these findingsillustrate the necessity, from the viewpoint of taxonomy, of comparingmycoplasma strains by serological methods.the serotypes of human and animal origin were largely host-specific.exceptions were the inclusion of m. arthritidis from rats and m. hominis type 2from man in a single serotype, the finding of a bovine organism among thestrains isolated from goats and of a saprophytic strain in a rat.in relation to the aetiology of disease in man and animals, the isolation ofan endogenous mycoplasma from embryonated eggs used to passage infectivematerial illustrates the importance of identifying these organismsserologically.  the demonstration of mixed mycoplasma infections in lesionsin two rats shows the necessity of adequately purifying all cultures ofmycoplasma before examination.

growth and survival of mycoplasma neurolyticum in liquid media.maximal growth of m. neurolyticum (between10 and 10 colony-forming units/ml)was obtained after 3 days of incubationat 36 c in broth media containing 10% agamahorse serum.  when whole horse serumwas used in the medium, a complement-mediatedinhibition was observed.  thisinhibition could only be detected when growthwas followed by daily plate counts.  maximalgrowth was delayed for about 24 hr bythe horse serum, and the inhibition wasspontaneously reversed at the temperatureof incubation.  penicillin g was also foundto have a temporary inhibitory effect.this was detected with as little as 40 units/ml.maximal growth was delayed untilthe 6th day of incubation, when 200 units/mlwas present, and until the 16th day,when 1,000 units/ml was present.  thesurvival of m. neurolyticum at undetectablelevels in cultures during the incubationperiod presented an 'eclipse' phenomenonwhich has not been explained.  the recrudescenceof growth in such cultures late inthe incubation period illustrates the eventswhich may occur when mycoplasmas areisolated from clinical material by prolongedincubation in the presence of inhibitorssurvival data showed that m. neurolyticumhad greatest stability at ph 8.0, withreduced viability at ph 9.0, 7.0, 10.0, and6.0, in that order.  the data on growthand stability suggest a close relationshipbetween the species of mycoplasma studiesand bacteria.

electron microscopic studies of mycoplasma (pplo strain 880) inartificial medium and in tissue culture.mycoplasma strain 880, isolated from a leukemicpatient, was studied in brothcultures and in several cell culture lines.this strain exhibited considerable pleomorphismin size, internal structure, andshape, including forms with filamentousprojections.  the most common form observedwas 0.5 to 1 in diameter andhad a nuclear area of fibrillar strands, probablydna.  the cytoplasm of the organismscontained ribosome-like granules anda flattened vacuole which indented thenuclear area.  there were various other forms,including 'elementary bodies' 100min diameter that were very electron-dense.in the tissue culture lines in whichthe cells grew as a monolayer, the mycoplasmawere closely associated with thecell surface and were occasionally seen inmembrane-lined cytoplasmic vacuoles.in cell lines that did not attach to the glass,the mycoplasma were fewer and notattached to the cell surface.  although theultrastructure of this strain is similarto that of previously described strains, thereare differences in details of structurewhich may be related either to the growthconditions used or to characteristics ofthe strain.  the various forms of the organismare consistent with the suggestionthat mycoplasma may have several mechanismsof reproduction (growth).  the intracellularmycoplasma may be protected fromantibiotics.  this would partly explainthe difficulty of eradicating mycoplasma frominfected cell cultures.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero andin vitro with rubella virus.a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomeswas undertaken to determine if damageto the genetic apparatus of human cells maybe induced by rubella virus and whethersuch damage produces the pathology seenin newborns from mothers infected earlyin pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains wereinitiated in vitro from embryonic materialobtained by therapeutic abortion of fetusesfrom rubella-infected mothers.  embryonicmaterial from spontaneous and non-rubellatherapeutic abortions yielded similarcell strains for infection in vitro.  theresults from both types of studies were asfollows: (a) virus shedding cell strains wereobtained from all types of organs cultivated,which indicated wide disseminationof virus in the fetuses from rubella-infectedmothers.  (b) chronic infection couldreadily be established by in vitro infectionand no cytopathic effect was noted.(c) although many strains continued to shedvirus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,no changes in growth propertiesoccurred with the exception that infectedstrains from lung tissue showed limitedgrowth capacities.  (d) from observationsof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obviouschromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctionalchanges were observed instrains infected naturally or experimentally.(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derivedcell strains there was a marked elevationin frequency of chromosome breakage in3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlationbetween virus shedding in vitro andincreased chromosome breakage was notedalthough this was not complete.  (g) thecombined average frequency of chromosomebreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortionstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortusstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,but significant elevation in average chromosomebreak frequency (9.8%) was obtainedin four cell strains which had been experimentallyinfected in vitro with rubella virus(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effectsupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,these were restricted to slight general elevationsin frequency of breakage abovenormal values.  very high increases in breakswere sporadic.  it appears more likelythat the general fetal abnormalities associatedwith rubella infection in vivo resultfrom possible effects of the virus upon growthrather than from effects upon thechromosomes.  however, the studies wererestricted to fibroblasts cultured invitro; and effects on other types of cellsmay have greater implications for thisquestion.

respiratory virus vaccines. ii. mycoplasma pneumoniae (eaton agent)vaccines.purified and concentrated formalin-killed vaccineswere prepared from m. pneumoniae propagated inserum-free artificial medium.  the vaccines wereaqueous or were incorporated in alum or emulsifiedpeanut oil (adjuvant 65) adjuvant.  two or 3 differentconcentrations of mycoplasma were included in eachpreparation.  serum neutralizing and cf antibody responseswere measured in hamsters, monkeys, and ininstitutionalized persons following 1,2,3 and sometimes4 vaccinations.  all of the preparations werehighly antigenic in animals and in man.  alum vaccineswere better than aqueous vaccines and those in adjuvant65 appeared to give best results although the bleedingtimes were not always optimal for demonstratingmaximal effect.  persons who were without detectableantibody initially and thus would be most vulnerable toinfection gave better responses to the vaccine than didthose with pre-existing antibody.  alum vaccine is anacceptable formulation for use in man, and only 2 dosesof such vaccine were necessary to induce neutralizingantibody in 90% of the persons who were initially withoutdetectable antibody.  no local or systemic reactionof clinical consequence was noted in any of the personsvaccinated.  recent unpublished findings, which indicatea high degree of effectiveness of the alum vaccinein stimulating antibody in preschool children and inprotecting children and adults against the natural disease,are mentioned.

the inhibition of cell aggregation by a pureserum proteinthe aggregation of embryonic chick and quail limb bud, heart and liver cellsin a shaker system has been investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism ofcell adhesion.a new method of assessing aggregation is described and evaluated; thismethod involved measurements of aggregation kinetics.  it was found that themeasured kinetics agree closely with flocculation kinetics, which provides adirect quantitative measurement of adhesiveness in terms of theprobability of an adhesion forming on contact between two cells.using this technique it was confirmed that aggregation is inhibited at1-2 c. in the presence of serum but not in its absence.  the kinetics ofaggregation in the presence of serum at 37 c., the lack of inhibition ofaggregation at 1-2 c. by serum which has been 'conditioned' by the presence ofcells, and the similar lack of inhibitory power of serum which has beenpre-treated with antiserum antibodies, all suggest that serum contains afactor which inhibits aggregation until destroyed by cellular metabolism.

some observations on the effects in vivo of varying ambient temperatureson filarial worms of snakes.new information was obtained on the biologyof filarial worms from experimentsusing constrictor constrictor mexicanusboas, infected with macdonaldius oscheiworms.  the microfilariae of m. oschei areaperiodic with respect to the light cycle,but fluctuate sharply in density from dayto day.  maximum minimum levels occurapprox. 2 days apart.  the microfilariaeare larger and more variable in size onthe days of maximum density than on thedays of minimum density.  it is suggestedthat the smaller microfilariae on the daysof low parasitemia are those that havebeen born recently and that they enlargeduring the following 48 hr. before they enterthe peripheral capillaries.  low ambienttemperatures have little effect upon m.oschei.  exposure of the host to ambient temperaturesabove 36 c for a period of24-48 hr. appears sufficient to kill adultm. oschei.  all microfilariae apparently diewithin 144 hr. at this temperature, and inslight infections.  they disappeared fromthe blood altogether within that period.  microfilariaefrom an infection 20 timesmore severe, however, were not eliminatedfrom the circulation prior to the deathof the host after 288 hr., although all thoseobserved were either decomposed ordistorted and apparently dead.  the indicationthat the temperature serves as a limitingfactor for the parasite at a point severaldegrees lower than that postulated forthe host species, is probably correlatedwith the nocturnal habits of the host.

3105. studies on the subunits of a-crystallin and their recombi-nationearlier investigations have shown that, inthe presence of high concentrations ofurea, a-crystallin from bovine lens is splitinto a number of subunits with apparent-ly different electrophoretic mobilities butsimilar molecular weights.  the recom-bination of these subunits after removal ofthe urea has been studied by ultracentri-fugation and immunoprecipitation techniques.it was found that maximal recombina-tion was obtained when the ionic strengthduring the removal of the urea was high(>0.2), whereas at low ionic strengths amolecule with only half the molecular weightof native a-crystallin and a much lowersedimentation coefficient was obtained.  acomplete recovery of the structure ofnative a-crystallin was never obtained, evenat high ionic strengths, as was evidentfrom electrophoretic and quantitative preci-pitin analyses.  the subunits werefractionated by chromatography on deae-cellu-lose in the presence of 7 m urea.the purification was followed by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis.  after removal ofthe urea at high ionic strength, 2 of thefractions obtained showed reactions ofonly partial identity with native a-crystallinin immunodiffusion tests, but all otherfractions showed complete identity.  thedifferences in the electrophoreticmobilities of the fractions in the presence ofurea persisted after removal of the urea.all fractions had much higher sedimen-tation coefficients in the absence of ureathan in its presence, although the valuesfor urea-treated unfractionated a-crystallinobtained after removal of the ureawere not reached even at high ionic strengths.the amino acid composition of thefractions was found to differ.  theseobservations suggest that a-crystallin is com-posed of a number of chemically different,but related, subunits of approximatelythe same size, which are bound togetherby nonspecific, noncovalent bonds, pos-sibly hydrophobic bonds.  moreover,when isolated, these subunits have the abilityto associate and form molecules ofhigh molecular weight.

major surgery on the severe hemophiliac, lessons in management.three cases of pseudotumor of the thigh whichrequired surgical amputation and onecase of open pericardial drainage for cardiactamponade are briefly reported in severehemophiliacs.  in the first case hemostasis, followingamputation, was produced, but thepatient died of septicemia secondary to proximallyinfected tissues; the level of amputationshould, therefore, be proximal to all grosslyinfected tissues.  in the second case, withinfected massive pseudotumor of the left thigh,5 separate operative procedures wereperformed.  the last procedure was elective revisionof skin flaps at the hip disarticulationsite.  here application of the knowledge gainedfrom previous experience resulted in a completelyuncomplicated postoperative course bydint of timing of the surgical procedurein relation to control of infection, loss of plasmafastness, and the judicious use of antibioticand direct-current electrocoagulation therapy.a plea is made to avoid the useof plasma and ahg therapy in hemophiliasfor trivial reasons and to consider patientsfor surgical procedures early in the course of theircomplications, which demand surgery,at a time when the patient is still responsiveto hematologic therapy and prior to theonset of infection in areas of hematoma.  it isfelt that a second significant hemorrhagein any particular site constitutes a bona fideindication for surgical intervention, longbefore the time when surgery is considered asthe last resort by the physician, patient andfamily.  although the authors believe that surgeryin the hemophiliac is not to be takenlightly, they do not endorse the prevailing nihilisticattitude that has resulted in temporizingdelays which can only guarantee a fatal outcome.

pleuropneumonia-like organismsdespite their small size, the pplo carrythe full complement of the chemical com-pounds and enzymes contained in largerbacteria and in cells.  they contain bothdna and rna, and in their independentmetabolism they are essentially like other freeliving cells in contrast to the viruses whichhave no independent metabolism outside theliving host cell.  several strains of pplo havebeen cultivated from the mucous membranesof apparently normal human subjects, espe-cially from the respiratory and urinary tracts.until recently, however, definite evidence ofthe association between the pplo and clear-ly defined clinical disease in the human sub-ject was lacking.  in 1962 it became evidentthat the so-called eaton "virus," originallyisolated by eaton and his associates in 1944from patients with primary atypical pneu-monia, was in reality a pleuropneumonia-likeorganism.  typical pplo colonies are pro-duced on a cell-free agar medium which isenriched by the addition of blood serum oryeast.  a number of strains of pplo has nowbeen identified, and in recognition of theirunique characteristics, they have been classi-fied in a separate order, the mycoplasmatales,genus mycoplasma.

incidence of symptoms of early infantile autism insubsequently hospitalized psychiatric patientsthis study was concerned with therelationship between the occurrence dur-ing the first two years of life of symptomsof early infantile autism, as retrospective-ly reported by the mothers of s's andsubsequent adjustment.  the mothers of69 unmarried young hospitalized psychia-tric patients were interviewed to deter-mine the presence or absence of each of28 different signs contained in a checklist.  the signs represent characteristicfeatures that are reportedly often foundin conjunction with early infantile autism.as a control, 50 mothers of high schoolstudents residing in the community andpresenting no significant adjustment prob-lems were questioned in regard to thevery same items.the results indicated that there weresignificantly more symptoms reported forpatients than for normals, and that thisfinding applied to the overall number ofsymptoms as well as to several subcate-gories of symptoms.  the items classifiedunder the heading of "social withdrawal"appeared to be the most sensitive in dif-ferentiating the groups.  it was also foundthat 11 of the 28 signs distinguished be-tween the patients and normals, with allexcept one occurring more frequently inthe former group.  it was concluded thata significant relationship existed betweenthe reported presence of symptoms thatare often associated with severe and earlyego impairment and subsequent status asa mental hospital patient.  this study doesnot provide any direct answer to the ques-tion of what proportion of children withinfantile autism are later able to make anadequate adjustment outside of a mentalhospital.

mammalian cell cultures contaminated withpleuropneumonia-like organismsii. effect of pplo on cell morphology in establishedmonolayer culturesthe occurrence of cytopathogenic changes in monolayer cultures ofpplo-contaminated mammalian cells has been shown to be related todeficiency of arginine in the medium.  the same effects were seen when thecell culture medium was depleted by pplo prior to application to pplo-freecell cultures even though viable pplo were no longer present.  the fact thatthe same picture resulted in the absence of pplo when either arginine orglucose were omitted from the medium would indicate that, while the defi-ciency created under the conditions described was specific, the cellularchanges could as well be the result of omission or depletion of other mam-malian cell growth requirements.  the importance of surveillance of celllines for the presence of pplo to avoid misinterpretation of cytopathogeniceffects was stressed.

bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexusa rare case of bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexusin a five-and-a-half-year old hydrocephalic girl is pre-sented.the tumor encountered at autopsy was not suspectedduring life, the existing hydrocephalus being attributedto either cytomegalic inclusion disease or toxoplasmosis.after post mortem examination, it was evident thatthe hydrocephalus was due to two factors; hypersecretionfrom the tumor itself, and obstruction at the level of thesylvian aqueduct by a delicate, tense, translucent mem-brane.an interesting and uncommon additional feature ofthis case was the presence, within the choroidal papillo-ma, of well-formed haversian bone.a plea is made for regularly considering papilloma ofthe choroid plexus in the differential diagnosis of hydro-cephalus in children, for here, early diagnosis and treat-ment might conceivably result in total cure.

localization of phosphaturic effect ofparathyroid hormone in nephron of the dogthe renal mechanism and tubular site of the phosphaturic action ofparathyroid hormone were investigated by clearance and stop-flowtechniques in one intact and seven thyroparathyroidectomizeddogs.  administration of hormone caused a significant increasein the excretion of phosphate without increasing the filteredload.  stop-flow analysis indicated that in the absence of parathyroidhormone most of the filtered phosphate was reabsorbedin the proximal tubule, and that the hormone increased therate of phosphate excretion by inhibiting this reabsorptivemechanism.  p32 injected during stopped flow showed no significanttransport across the renal tubule despite the presence ofexcess parathyroid hormone.  significant p32 activity appearedin the stop-flow collections simultaneously with the appearanceof new filtrate.  there was no evidence that parathyroid hormonemediated a secretory process for phosphate excretion.
