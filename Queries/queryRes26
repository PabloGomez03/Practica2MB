3083. myocardial toxicity of contrast agents used in angiographythe myocardial toxicity of many current andsome experimental contrast agentshas been studied in dogs, by use of a previouslyunreported method of occlusionretrograde coronary venography as well as thefamiliar technique of selectivecoronary arterial catheterization.  the followingconclusions appear justified inthe light of the experiments   not only theiodine-containing radicals with which thecontrast agents are so often identified (acetrizoates,diatrizoates, iothalamates,etc.), but also the final salification products appearto be responsible for the widelydivergent degrees of myocardial toxicity of contrastagents, to the point that differ-ent salts of the same compound behave as entirelydifferent agents both chemicallyand biologically.  the results seem to indicate thedominance of sodium ion and/orthe protective effect of methylglucamine salts withrespect to the myocardial toxi-city of current radiopaque media.  reported,yet unexplained, electrocardiographicchanges occurring within one to two secondsfrom the beginning of massive cavalhigh-pressure injections appear to find acausal relationship in the myocardial ir-ritability induced by the distention of thecoronary veins and the myocardial infiltra-tion which is intentionally enhanced withour retrograde injection techniques.  a pe-culiar trait, shared in varying degrees byall radiopaque agents tested, is theirability to increase coronary blood flow.the clinical significance of this phenome-non, however, remains to be established.these studies re-emphasize the limita-tions of the standard toxicity studies conductedin animals.  it should be clear fromthe results reported that agents to beadministered into the coronary circulationdemand investigation in regard to theirpotential toxicity by the methods describedherein or variations thereof.  in fact,similar tests should be carried out for all or-gans to be subjected to radiographicexamination via the vascular bed.  the authorshope that this presentation will stimulaterenewed investigation, particularly in viewof the growing clinical applications ofselective cardiovascular opacification tech-niques.

effect of heterologous antiserum and complement on glycolysis of tumorcells .the effect of heterologous antiserum and complement on glucosemetabolism of rat ascites tumor cells was examined to clarify themechanism of the cytotoxic effect of antibody .1. lactate-production of the target cells was inhibited by thecooperation of antiserum and complement, while no inhibition wasobserved when the cells were subjected to either antiserum or complementalone . the inhibition of lactate-production was observed under bothacrobic and anacrobic conditions . no effect of the antiserum andcomplement was observed on the oxygen consumption of the cells .2. the amount of antiserum necessary for the inhibition oflactate-production of the cells was determined in the presence of adefinite amount of complement, and it was found that the degree ofinhibition was not in parallel with the concentration of antiserumbeyond a certain threshold . on the other hand, a parallelism wasobserved between the amount of complement and the rate of inhibition oflactate-production when different amounts of complement were added to adefinite amount of antiserum .3. similar inhibitory effects of the antiserum and complement onlactate-production of the cells from glucose, fructose-1, 6-diphosphate,and pyruvate suggested that the inhibition occurred toward the finalstep of glycolytic process of the cells .

oophorectomy and cortisone treatment as a method of eliminatingoestrogen production in patients with breast cancer .the urinary excretion of oestrone, oestradiol-17b, oestriol, and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids has been estimated in 55 premenopausal and 91postmenopausal women with breast cancer at various stages of the diseasebefore therapy . the depletion of oestrogen excretion caused byoophorectomy combined with cortisone treatment was studied in thepatients with metastasising breast tumours (32 premenopausal and 56postmenopausal subjects) .patients with disseminating breast cancer excreted significantlylarger quantities of oestriol than healthy women of the same age,whether pre- or postmenopausal . the excretion of oestrone andoestradiol-17b was similar in cancer patients and healthy women ofcorresponding age .oophorectomy reduced the oestrogen excretion not only in premenopausalsubjects but also in quite a number of postmenopausal patients,particularly in those who were still excreting significant amounts ofoestrogens . this decrease in the oestrogen output was transient and wasfollowed by a compensatory increase, possibly of adrenal origin .cortisone administered within a month after the oophorectomy at adosage of 50 mg per day rapidly depressed the secondary rise in theoestrogen output to a level of about 4 to 5 ug/24 h irrespective of theage of the patient . this excretion level was unchanged as long ascortisone was given in an adequate dose, but increased rapidly when thecortisone treatment was discontinued .oophorectomy combined with adequate cortisone treatment seems to offeran alternative to the extensive surgical porcedures undertaken toeliminate oestrogen production in breast cancer patients .

the convergence and interaction of visual,auditory, and tactile responses in humannonspecific cortexthe relation between the electrical responses in the human brain andmental processes of integration and association is perhaps the most chal-lenging of all the problems facing neurophysiologists today.  until quiterecently the prospect of unifying physiological and psychological conceptsby electro-encephalographic (eeg) techniques seemed to be recedingbecause of the baffling complexity of the intrinsic electrical rhythms, andthis difficulty has still not been overcome.  the most intriguing, and atthe same time most elusive, of the properties of these rhythms is that,although often remarkably constant in their variations with respect totime, they fluctuate also, in a much less regular manner, within the threedimensional space of the brain.  the continuous analysis and display ofsuch a phenomenon presents serious difficulties, and no method has yetgiven entirely satisfactory results.the incentive to construct adequate equipment and to design and per-form crucial experiments is undoubtedly limited by the uncertainty asto whether the information likely to be obtained in this way is essentialto understanding brain mechanisms; few experimenters imagine that itwould be sufficient.

studies on loiasis in monkeys.iv.--experimental hybridization of the human andsimian strains of loain the cameroons rain-forest there exist two strains of loa, each apparentlyevolving in its own host-vector complex (duke and wijers, 1958).  the naturalsimian parasite which is found most abundantly in the drill (mandrillusleucophaeus), is characterized by the large somatic size of the adult wormsand microfilariae and by its nocturnal microfilariae periodicity.  it istransmitted among the monkey population by the crepuscular canopy-dwellingchrysops langi and c. centurionis.  the natural human parasite has diurnallyperiodic microfilariae and is transmitted by the day-biting anthropophilicc. silacea and c. dimidiata (bombe form).  it can also be transmittedexperimentally to the drill, in which host the parasites are of small somaticsize and maintain their diurnal periodicity.as the two strains of contrasting periodicity can be maintained in drills, itwas decided to try cross-mating them to produce hybrids.  the present paperdescribes the methods by which this was done, records the characteristics ofthe hybrid parasites, and suggests that, when interbreeding, the two strainssegregate according to a simple mendelian pattern as regards periodicity andsomatic size.

2284. analogs parasympathetic neuroeffectors.  ii. comparative pharmacologicalstudies of acetylcholine, its thio and seleno analogs, and their hydrolysisproductsacetylthiocholine and acetylselenocholine exert acetylcholine-like effects onthe guinea-pig ileum and frog rectus abdominis preparations.  with thelatter preparation, responses to acetylthiocholine and acetylselenocholine,in contrast to that to acetylcholine, are not enhanced by the addition of ananticholinesterase.  this is attributable to the relatively high activity ofthe hydrolysis products, cholinethiol and cholineselenol; acetylthiocholineand acetyselenocholine undergo enzymatic hydrolysis at approximately the samerate as does acetylcholine.  the hydrolysis products of acetylthiocholine andacetylselenocholine, which have effects on the guinea-pig ileum comparableto those of the parent esters, are readily oxidized in air to the relativelyinactive choline disulfide and choline diselenide, respectively.  theseobservations are helpful in explaining many of the apparently contradictorystatements in the literature regarding the actions of acetylthiocholine.

experimental onchocercal ocular lesions in the chimpanzeethis is the first attempt to produceonchocercal eye lesions with microfilariae ofo. volvulus in the chimpanzee.live microfilariae, once in the anteriorchamber of the eye, could penetrate the an-gle of the anterior chamber, the iris, theciliary body, the choroid and the vitreous.most of the microfilariae injected aliveinto the anterior chamber of the eyes of thechimpanzee died within a short time.  com-parison, therefore, could not be made be-tween the effects of live and dead micro-filariae.microfilariae debris was demonstratedwithin giant cells for the first time.subconjunctival and limbal infiltrationwith incipient pannus, inflammation withinthe trabecular meshwork of the angle of theanterior chamber and extensive active iri-docyclitis were demonstrated in histologicsections, although the conditions were clini-cally quiescent.the posterior segment lesion of oncho-cercal chorioretinal degeneration could notbe reproduced.subcutaneous and intravenous injec-tions of worm extracts, derived from humanonchocercomas, may have contributed to theonset of active choroiditis.  this sensitizationalone, without the intraocular injection ofmicrofilariae, had no effects on the eye.various aspects of the pathogenesis ofhuman onchocerciasis are discussed on thebasis of present experimentation.

actinomycin and erythropoiesis and the production of erythropoietin inmice.in b6d2f female mice a single dose of 10of actinomycin will suppress normalerythropoiesis (fe erythrocyte uptake).  inpolycythemic mice 2 is enough toprevent the stimulatory effect of 0.25 a unitsof erythropoietin.  the curves of suppressionand recovery versus time support thehypothesis that erythropoietin actsfor a short time in an early stage oferythropoiesis; after this early stage developingcells are no longer so sensitive to actinomycin.recovery, even from repeateddoses, is rapid and adequate.  amounts ofactinomycin which are adequate to abolisherythropoiesis do not prevent the new appearanceof erythropoietin in the plasma ofhypoxic mice.

1545. the effect of combined glucose and insulin infusions onthe lipoid and carbohydrate metabolism of the parturientwoman and of the fetusthe infusion of glucose with insulin during deliverywas used by the authors pri-marily in order to determine, whether the utilizationof glucose can be enhancedunder these conditions.  they wanted to investigate,whether the increase of unesteri-fied fatty acids in the cord blood which takes placeafter a sole glucose infusion inthe mother, could be caused by the low capabilityof glucose utilization in the fetus.the infusion during delivery which consisted of theapplication of 500 ml of 10%glucose and 16 u of insulin over a period of 30 min.brought about a greater decreaseof unesterified fatty acids in the parturient womanas compared with the infusion ofglucose exclusively.  the reason for this resultis thought to be due to a better utili-zation of glucose which is favorably influencedby insulin.  during the infusion ofglucose with insulin, an increase in the valuesof lactic and pyruvic acid took placein the parturient women; this was probably dueto an accelerated glycolysis and anincreased production of lactic acid, but notcaused by a higher share of the anaerobicmetabolism.  in the cord blood, there werelikewise increased values of lactic and py-ruvic acid as a reflection of the higher valuesof these substances in the mother.  theformation of these products of metabolicbreakdown by the fetus, however, was notsignificantly increased.  after infusion ofglucose with insulin, the other investigatedparameter values, including those of the levelsof unesterified fatty acids are foundin the cord blood in similar amounts as afterinfusion of glucose alone.  these re-sults cannot reliably prove the passage ofinsulin through the placenta especiallyafter a continued study of the metabolic valuesin newborns.  as a proof of the passageof insulin through the placenta could not beestablished, it is possible that after anintake of insulin the increase of unesterifiedfatty acids in the cord blood could becaused by a relative insufficiency of the insularapparatus of the fetus.  the mostprobable reason for the increase of unesterifiedfatty acids is the different depo-sition and metabolization of unesterified fattyacids in the course of intrauterinelife.

neuroaxonal dystrophy in congenitalbiliary atresianeuroaxonal dystrophy has been described in 8 patients with congenitalbiliary atresia.  the characteristic changes include axonal dystrophy, a mildloss of nerve cells and a variable degree of astrocytic reaction, mainly in thegracile, cuneate and trigeminal nerve nuclei in the medulla, and rarely inother parts of the central nervous system.the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is remarkably similar to thatin patients with prolonged mucoviscidosis and in experimental vitamine-deficient rats.it is strongly suggested that the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patientswith congenital biliary atresia is a manifestation of prolonged vitamin edeficiency.the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is also similar to that seenin aging and bears resemblance to the axonal change encountered in a groupof heredo-degenerative diseases, the various forms of "hallervorden-spatzdisease".  the pathological similarity between these diverse conditionswarrants further investigation as to the possible metabolicrelationship between them.

cell proliferation in compensatory renal growthrats with one kidney removed showed a progressive increase in weight of theremaining kidney over a six-week period.autoradiographic and radiochemical studies with 3h-thymidine indicated that theincrease in new kidney cell formation was maximal forty-eight to seventy-twohours after unilateral nephrectomy.  this early response was chiefly due to theproduction of new cells by the renal cortical tubules.  normal rates of tubulecell turnover were achieved two weeks after operation.  the glomerular tuftscontained fewer new cells and their peak production was delayed to theone-week period with a slow decline thereafter.rats forty-eight hours after unilateral nephrectomy were chosen as a model tostudy the effect of various substances on the magnitude of new cell formation.the number of dna-synthesising cells in the stimulated kidney was reduced bytreatment with hydrocortisone, acth, 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, and1,2-benzanthracene; the numbers were increased by the administration ofdeoxycorticosterone and aldosterone.

2579. measurement of aortic regurgitation by upstream sampling with continuousinfusion of indicatora direct and theoretically valid methodfor the measurement of aortic regurgitationinvolves the recording of indicator concentrationsfrom the left ventricle and a down-stream site during aortic root injection.  however,this method has yielded erraticresults when applied to man in the authors'laboratory when using the sudden in-jection technique.  therefore, the upstreamsampling method, using continuous in-fusion of indicator, was evaluated in 18 patientswith aortic regurgitation duringretrograde aortic and transseptal left ventricularcatheterization.  the continuousinfusion technique was compared with the techniqueof sudden injection in 10 patientsand with aortic valvulography in 14 patients.measurements of forward flow obtainedwith continuous infusions into the aortic rootwere not significantly different frommeasurements obtained with sudden injectionsinto the pulmonary artery.  recordingsof indicator concentrations from the left ventricle,during continuous infusions intothe aortic root, demonstrated readily evidentequilibrium plateaus.  the resultantmeasurements of regurgitant flow were highlyreproducible and not impaired bynonsimultaneity of upstream and downstreamsampling.  the percentage error ofestimate at 95% confidence limits was 22% ofthe measurement for regurgitant flow,13% for total flow, and 9% for the regurgitantfraction of total flow.  the correspond-ing errors of estimate for the sudden injectiontechnique were 4 times larger.  re-gurgitant flow by the continuous infusion methodranged from 0.8-30.0 l/min, totalflow from 3.0-36.0 l/min, and the regurgitantfraction of total flow from 12-86%.ranking of patients by the magnitudes of regurgitantand total flow did not correspondto ranking by angiographic criteria of severity.however, an excellent correlationprevailed between angiographic grade and the regurgitantfraction of total flow,demonstrating that this variable is the most meaningfulexpression of severity.  thecorrelation (0.997) between the angiographic grade andthe regurgitant fractionmeasured by the continuous infusion technique wasclearly superior to that obtainedwith the sudden injection technique (0.894).  mildregurgitation was equivalent toa regurgitant fraction of <25%, moderateregurgitation to a fraction of 25-50%,moderately severe regurgitation to a fractionof 50-75% and severe regurgitation toa fraction of >75%.  it is concluded that theupstream sampling method during con-tinuous infusion of indicator, because of itssensitivity, reliability, applicability tomultiple measurements, and validity in thepresence of mitral regurgitation is themost useful method for quantifying aorticregurgitation in man.

(a) explantationinto several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed byreimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantationfollowed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity .specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lensmaterial of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serialsections . the results were interpreted as follows..1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium,embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount ofindependent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they failto undergo any fiber formation .2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explantswill respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellulardifferentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changesnecessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support theseresponses .3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficientfor their complete autonomous maturation .4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the onlydeterminant of its overall shape .

948.cardiac activity in cranio-cerebral hypothermiathe onset of hypothermia rarely alters the heartrate.  as it deepens to 35-32, therate slows, and at the level of 30-29 it usuallyamounts to only half its original va-lue.  at 28 or below, the development ofbradycardia is observed.  after warmingto 32 the normal heart rate is restored.during operations on the abdominal organsthe heart rate is only slightly modified.the appearance of solitary extrasystoles israre and is usually associated with stimulationof the diaphragm.  the most markedchanges in the heart rate are observed during operations on the heart,especially ifit is excluded from the circulation.  anidioventricular rhythm may develop beforethe heart stops beating.  after removal of theligatures from the venae cavae the nor-mal rhythm is restored.  as the temperaturefalls, the excitability of the myocardiumincreases.  conduction is more resistant.areflexia continues even during direct sti-mulation of reflexogenic zones.  in the surgicalstage of cranio-cerebral hypothermiait is clear that no significant degree of energyor hemodynamic insufficiency deve-lops, whether in experimental conditions orduring operations on patients.  at opera-tion a well-marked stabilization of the contractilepower of the myocardium may be observed.

a kinetic study of nickel(ii), complexes of sulfur-containing amino acidthe rate expression for the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta)ligand exchange reaction with nickel(cysteine) is.. rate = k(complex) +kedta (complex)(edta) . this two-term rate expression is characteristicof square planar complexes and agrees with the square planarconfiguration of ni(cysteine) reported on the basis of spectral studiesthe edta-independent term of the rate expression is an acid-catalyzedterm and can be written k (h) (complex) . the value of kn is 2.5 x 10 msec while the value of kedta is only on the order of 10 -10 m sec . theedta reaction with ni(cysteine) methyl ester) is very similar to thereaction with ni(cysteine) . when the sulfur-containing amino acidligand contains a thiol ether, the kinetic differences are striking .ligand exchange reactions of edta, triethylenetetramine, anddiethylenetriamine with nickel-methionine complexes are several ordersof magnitude faster and give products that are mixed-ligand complexes .the results of this kinetic study of amino acid complexes containingsulfhydryl and thiol ether sulfur groups support other studies atequilibrium which suggest sulfur coordination and square planarcomplexes for the sulfhydryl groups and octahedral complexes with nosulfur coordination for thiol ethers .

visual neglect .clinical trainees in nursing and in psychology from boston college andsimmons college, boston, mass., collected data and observed patientsunder the direction of the authors in a pilot program designed tomeasure visual spatial neglect and to develop rehabilitative material .these measurements and exercises might also be used by nurses in theircare of those patients who have had cerebral vascular accidents .the diversity of daily activities in which the patient becomesinvolved during his hospitalization should provide some indication ofthe extent to which the compensatory visual neglect therapeutics havebeen effective . more formal estimates can be obtained byre-administering the battery of visual neglect tests at periodicintervals . nursing personnel adopting a program of therapeutics such asthis must bear in mind that patients suffering cerebral insult areusually less adaptive than their nonbrain-injured peers . they developnew habit patterns slowly and regression often will follow apparentfixation at a more adaptive level of response habituation(11) . however,experimental inquiry has shown that the dimension of behavioraldifference between the brain-injured adults and normal adults is one ofdegree rather than kind -dash a difference that skilled nursing canoften reduce(12) .

children at kelbournekelbourne school, glasgow, which educates bothspastic and aphasic children, is the first school of itskind to be administered by a local education authority.its aphasic department, largely experimental in nature,contains children aged three to eight.  in the spasticsdepartment there are 45 children with severe physicalhandicaps and their ages range from 3 to 16.the school, which celebrated its golden jubilee last year,has its origins in the maryhill hall public school fordefective and epileptic children which opened in 1907with 12 pupils in premises of which, as an h.m.i. reportedfour years later, 'it was impossible to speak favourably'.the report continued, 'a public hall, used frequently inthe evenings for public entertainments, lacking propercloakrooms, bare in appearance, and generally comfortless,should not be used for this purpose'.  the inspector'swords did not go unheeded and seven years later thechildren were transferred with others to the new buildingsof percy street special school.  in the 1950s the name waschanged to kelbourne school.between and through two world wars the schoolprovided education for physically and mentally handicappedchildren but in 1955 a new unit was added andspastic children were admitted for the first time.gradually the emphasis shifted from children with otherphysical and mental handicaps to the cerebrally palsiedand finally the entire building became available forspastics.  two years ago the aphasic children joined theschool.  miss e.f. hamilton is the headmistress.

experimental studies on cerebrospinalfluid flowa mixed suspension of kaolin and lyco-podium was injected into the cisterna magnaof dogs.  blockade of csf space was producedsuccessfully in 63 of 75 dogs; in 48 of the 63,ventricular dilatation of more than interme-diate degree was observed.in these hydrocephalic dogs experimentalshunting was performed either between thelateral ventricle and the lumbar cistern or be-tween the unilateral lateral ventricle and thecontralateral cerebral subarachnoid space.  uni-directional, steady csf flow averaged 0.15 ml. perhour in the cases of the former shunting,and the flow averaged 0.25 ml. per hour in thecases of the latter shunting.csf flow rate from the ventricle toward thecerebral subarachnoid space was larger whenintraventricular pressure was higher.  this in-crease in flow rate parallel to increasing pres-sure probably results from an increase in csfabsorption.  there seems to be an upper limitof the flow rate as the pressure is raised.transient reflux of csf flow was induced byjugular or abdominal compression.following intravenous administration of hy-pertonic solutions, csf flow rate decreasedparallel to the fall of csf pressure and re-gained the original value as the pressure wasrecovered.  when the pressure fell as low as50 mm. of water the flow almost stopped.

major surgery in classic hemophilia using fraction i.  experience intwelve operations and review of the literature.a therapeutic regimen that provides hemostasis inhemophiliacs during and after major surgery without requiringlaboratory control has been established with afactor viii concentrate.  the effectiveness of this regimenof fraction i therapy was evaluated in major surgeryof 6 severely deficient and 4 moderately deficient hemophiliacs.an analysis of clinical results was made, combiningthe 12 operations of the series with the 116 majoroperative procedures on hemophiliacs recorded in theenglish literature, in which fraction i was the sole ormajor source of factor viii therapy.  dental and nondentalsurgery were analyzed separately, as was thespecial problem of blood cysts.  although the over-allmortality rate following major surgery in hemophiliacsis presently only 5 to 10% using factor viii concentrates,problems still remain.  these include the continued highincidence of abnormal postoperative hemorrhage, thevariation in factor viii potency of different lots of fractioni, the late development of serum hepatitis, hemolyticanemia due to contaminating isoantibodies and thehigh cost of adequate amounts of the product.  more efficientmethods of preparing purer and more potent factorviii concentrates could eliminate most of these difficulties.
