free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fatcontent .subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into femalesprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasmafree fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group ofpregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times dailythroughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than thefetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that thematernal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fataccumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted inbabies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormallyhigh maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations .

3682. metabolism of free fatty acids during perinatal life of lambsthere is a rapid rise of free fatty acidsin blood plasma after birth in newbornlambs.  this study confirms this rise,caused by an augmented mobilization of theseacids from the tissues.  norepinephrineeasily mobilizes free fatty acids in adultewes.  in newborn lambs this special effectis lacking, though cardiovascular re-sponses are clearly demonstrable.  blockingthe sympathetic nervous system innewborn lambs inhibits the rapid rise of freefatty acids after birth.  this is com-patible with the concept, that increased activityof these sympathetic nerves afterbirth is an important factor for free fatty acidsmobilization.  during intrauterinelife there is an ample study of carbohydratesand the organism uses them as anenergy source.  hypoglycaemia resulting fromsudden carbohydrate deprivation atbirth, demonstrates with rising free fatty acidsthe change-over to (tissue) fat asmain source of energy.

1545. the effect of combined glucose and insulin infusions onthe lipoid and carbohydrate metabolism of the parturientwoman and of the fetusthe infusion of glucose with insulin during deliverywas used by the authors pri-marily in order to determine, whether the utilizationof glucose can be enhancedunder these conditions.  they wanted to investigate,whether the increase of unesteri-fied fatty acids in the cord blood which takes placeafter a sole glucose infusion inthe mother, could be caused by the low capabilityof glucose utilization in the fetus.the infusion during delivery which consisted of theapplication of 500 ml of 10%glucose and 16 u of insulin over a period of 30 min.brought about a greater decreaseof unesterified fatty acids in the parturient womanas compared with the infusion ofglucose exclusively.  the reason for this resultis thought to be due to a better utili-zation of glucose which is favorably influencedby insulin.  during the infusion ofglucose with insulin, an increase in the valuesof lactic and pyruvic acid took placein the parturient women; this was probably dueto an accelerated glycolysis and anincreased production of lactic acid, but notcaused by a higher share of the anaerobicmetabolism.  in the cord blood, there werelikewise increased values of lactic and py-ruvic acid as a reflection of the higher valuesof these substances in the mother.  theformation of these products of metabolicbreakdown by the fetus, however, was notsignificantly increased.  after infusion ofglucose with insulin, the other investigatedparameter values, including those of the levelsof unesterified fatty acids are foundin the cord blood in similar amounts as afterinfusion of glucose alone.  these re-sults cannot reliably prove the passage ofinsulin through the placenta especiallyafter a continued study of the metabolic valuesin newborns.  as a proof of the passageof insulin through the placenta could not beestablished, it is possible that after anintake of insulin the increase of unesterifiedfatty acids in the cord blood could becaused by a relative insufficiency of the insularapparatus of the fetus.  the mostprobable reason for the increase of unesterifiedfatty acids is the different depo-sition and metabolization of unesterified fattyacids in the course of intrauterinelife.

766. a lipid-mobilizing substance in the serum of pregnant wo-men, of probable placental origina substance capable of inducing free fattyacid (ffa) release was found in the seraof 12 from 13 pregnant women.  the ratepididymal fat pad was used for bioassay.this substance circulates in late pregnancyand disappears within 5 days post partum.it is present in crude placental extracts andis removed by their deproteination.  itis nondialyzable.  application of pituitaryextraction procedure to placentae yieldedactive fractions where pituitary growthhormone is usually found.  in accordance withthese facts a hypothesis concerning a partof metabolic changes occurring during preg-nancy was pronounced as follows.  thedescribed substance diminishes maternal glu-cose consumption through the elevation ofplasma free fatty acids, or by direct in-hibition of glucose uptake, or both.  thispermits a preferential shunting of glucoseto the fetus.  at the same time, increasedplasma free fatty acid levels would serveas the alternative maternal energy substrate.elevated maternal insulin levels duringlate pregnancy stabilize the degree of maternallipid mobilization.  the contrainsulinproperties of a substance capable of mobilizingfree fatty acids and inhibiting mater-nal glucose utilization would pose a diabetogenicchallenge, and in the face of com-promised maternal insulin reserves, provokeovert or worsen existing diabetesmellitus.

4105. free fatty acid metabolism in chinese hamstersin normal chinese hamsters (cricetulusgriseus) the mean concentration of freefatty acids (ffa) in serum varied fromgroup to group, but was (1) consistently 4to 9 times greater than in rats, dogs,or man; (2) slightly higher than in syrianhamsters; (3) two- to four-fold higherthan in fasting or alloxan-diabetic rats.  theepididymal adipose tissue of the chinesehamster (1) had initial concentrations offfa comparable to those in the rat andsyrian hamster; (2) released, in the sametime interval, 8- to 10-fold more ffain vitro than this tissue of the rat; (3) hadhigher concentrations of ffa after incubationthan the incubated tissue of the rat.the retroperitoneal (perirenal) adipose tissueof the chinese hamster was less ac-tive in release of fatty acids in vitro than theepididymal, but was, however, moreactive than the epididymal adipose tissue ofthe rat.  these characteristics of ffametabolism in the chinese hamster wereapparently attributable to species, not toage, diet, or sex.  in the chinese hamster,the weight of the epididymal adipose tis-sue per gram of body was relatively high.it appears that in this species the rate ofrelease of fatty acids from adipose tissueis great, leading to high ffa concentra-tions in serum.  in chinese hamster and ratadipose tissues in vitro, glucose and in-sulin (separately) reduced the rate of releaseof ffa and the amount of ffa in thetissues, but glucose and insulin togetherproduced the greatest reduction.  the netreduction in ffa release by glucose andinsulin in vitro was greater in tissue fromthe chinese hamster.  insulin markedlyincreased glucose uptake by the adipose tis-sues of both species.  the possible relationof the results to spontaneous diabetes inthe chinese hamster is discussed.

growth hormonegrowth hormone influences protein, fat,carbohydrate, and mineral metabolism.  itpromotes nitrogen retention, growth ofcartilage, transportation of amino acidsthrough the cell wall, and incorporation ofamino acids into protein.  this factor mo-bilizes free fatty acids from adipose tissueand increases the serum concentration ofthese substances; long-term administrationof this hormone is followed by depletion ofbody fat stores and inhibition of fatty acidsynthesis.  in diabetic subjects growth hor-mone administration is followed by hyper-glycemia, glycosuria, and ketosis; its effecton carbohydrate metabolism in normal sub-jects is more subtle.  sodium, potassium, andinorganic phosphate are retained followingthe administration of growth hormone.hypercalciuria also accompanies such treat-ment, an effect mediated through the para-thyroid glands.human growth hormone may be detectedin the serum through the use of the radio-immunoassay.  the hypothalamus is inti-mately involved with the control of thesecretion and release of growth hormonefrom the pituitary.  there is a correlationbetween the availability of glucose for me-tabolism and the plasma concentration ofgrowth hormone; when glucose is unavail-able growth hormone is released in order toprovide a substitute source of energy, fattyacids.the administration of growth hormoneto the patient with hypopituitarism is fol-lowed by growth in many instances, but ithas not usually been effective in promotinggrowth in individuals with other abnormali-ties.  acquired resistance to the effect ofgrowth hormone is accompanied by the de-velopment of antibodies directed againstthis protein.

1163. the effect of glucose infusions on the lipoid and thecarbohydrate metabolism of the parturient woman andthe fetusin 20 parturient women who were given glucoseinfusions during the expulsive stageof labor, the authors were able to observe an unusualhyperglycemia and a decreasein unesterified fatty acids (uefa).  the uefa-levelusually increases regularlyduring delivery.  likewise, the values of esterifiedfatty acids (efa) showed an in-crease above the normally present levels in womenwho had received a glucose in-fusion during the expulsive stage of labor.  theresults show that during deliveryboth hyperglycemia and the increase in lipoidsare predominantly due to the energydemands of the organism.  however, there is alsoevidence that other, hitherto un-known factors may play a role.  in the fetus,the infusion of glucose leads to an in-creased glucose retention.  the infusion, however,does not bring about a decrease,but, contrary to the expectations, an increasein the uefa-values.  in general,such a reaction is not found in any of thesubsequent periods of life.  further inves-tigations were conducted in order to find anexplanation for the paradox uefa-reaction.  as shown by an analysis of the lacticacid and the pyruvic acid values, theincrease in the uefa can most probably not beattributed to an impairment in thefetal metabolic conditions.  the administrationof physiological saline infusions to10 parturient women under equal conditionsrevealed that the cause for the uefa-increase can apparently neither be found inhemodynamic changes due to the infusionnor in changes of the electrolyte balance, butrather in an adaptation insufficiencyof the fetal islet cells, respectively in a differentfat mobilization or fat deposition.

264. fluorescent antibodies to human cancer-specific dna andnuclear proteinsspecific antigens have been demonstratedin certain cancers.  in this study they wereobtained from an adenocarcinoma of thecolon and an ewing's sarcoma.  homogenateswere prepared and male rabbits wereimmunized.  the animals were bled to death10 days after the last injection.  testingincluded fluorescent antibody methods andagar-gel horizontal double-diffusion precipitintest.  the pattern of reaction of theseantibodies against various cancers seems tobe dependent upon the source of thecancerous dna-bound proteins and the saltconcentration used in their isolation.human cancer-specific cross nuclear antigensseem to be cross reacting ratherthan identical in structure.  the cancer-specificantibodies could be removed onlywith absorption of the immune globulins withcancerous tissues.  salt-soluble humandna-bound proteins from an adenocarcinomaof the colon and an ewing's sarcomainduced the formation of cancer specificantibodies which showed positive fta re-actions (to a maximum titer of 1/128) against95% of the cancerous tissues studied.these cancer-specific antibodies gavesimilar fta reactions with cell nuclei ofnormal appearing liver parenchymaadjacent to metastatic carcinoma of colon, nor-mal appearing colon near to metastaticcarcinoma of the colon, normal appearingcolon near to carcinoma of the colon,and a long-standing case of chronic ulcerativecolitis.  evidence is shown that this findingpossibly may represent a serologicaldetection of an early or latent cancerouschange in morphologically normal cells.these cancer-specific antigens have beenidentified as rounded, intranuclear dna-bodies and nuclear proteins which can bespecifically destroyed by dnase trypsin.

the effect of folic acid on growth and deoxyribonucleic acid synthesisin the rat kidney.the effect of a single injection of folic acid (250mg/kg of body wt) on growth of the rat kidney was studied.the patterns of the response were found to be essentiallysimilar in animals aged between 3 wk and 12 mth.maximum values of kidney weight and nucleic acid content,relative to body weight, were found at 4 days atfolate administration.  the increases in wet and dryweights at this time were approx. 80% and 30% resp.above the control weights, and the percentage dry matterof the kidney was significantly lower than normal duringthis period.  at 4 days the rna content of the kidney wasalso maximal, being about 90% greater than the controlvalue, and the dna content after 4 days was increasedby about 60%.  whereas the dna values in 6-wk-old ratswere slightly lower at 7 and 10 days than at 4 days, in12-mth-old animals a further small increase was observedat 7 days, suggesting a prolongation of dna synthesisin the older animals.  autoradiographic studies ofdna synthesis with thymidine-h have shown a greatlyincreased labeling index in all zones of the kidney followingfolate injection.  maximum values were observedat 48 hr in the cortical zone, but the patterns of thechanges in the medulla were less well defined.  the labellingindices in the kidneys of 12-mth-old rats remainedabove normal for a longer period than in 6-wk-old rats.these results concur with the evidence of an increaseddna contents of the kidneys of older rats between 4 and7 days after folate.

7839.cortical ph and the blood-brain barriera method was described for measuringthe ph, dc and ac potentials concurrentlyon the cerebral cortex of the adult cat,under conditions of controlled ventilation.kittens and rabbits were also studied.the cortical ph response to i.v. nahco3was acidic and was accompanied by adc negativity, while the blood became alkaline.such an acidic response was present inthe rabbit and kitten.  it was not presentin a number of other tissues in the cat,including the dura.  the cortical acidicresponse was not affected, qualitatively,by i.v. acetazolamide, prolonged hypoxiaor 10% (v/v) co2.  it was reduced reversiblyby 20% (v/v) co2.  it was not affectedby removal of the arachnoid membrane.the cortical ph response to an i.v. nh4+salt solution was complex.  nh4c1 did notproduce an alkaline response.  the corticalph response to an alkaline or an acidicsodium phosphate solution was augmentedbut not changed in its direction followingtreatment of the cortex with n-butanol.the results were interpreted in terms ofa restriction of hco3- by the blood-brainbarrier, through which co2 can pass.  thisrestriction is probably non-specific forinorganic ions, and perhaps for othersubstances.  it does not appear to be relatedto a low cerebral extracellular space,and is independent of substantial oxidative metabolism.

auto-radiographic studies of the protein metabolism of the singlekidney in the nephrectomized rat.rats were subjected to unilateral nephrectomy,following which the protein metabolismof the other kidney, which exerteda compensatory activity, was studiedwith h-labelled l-phenylalanine, at differentintervals (3hr. to 7 wk.).  twophases of enhanced incorporation of amino-acidsinto the cells of the convolutedtubules were found, with one maximumafter 6 hr., at which time the uptake islimited to the cytoplasm, and a 2nd maximumon the 4th day, when the nucleus isequally involved.  in the course of the 2ndphase of enhanced amino-acid uptake,there is also an increased mitotic indexof the epithelia of the tubules.  in thecollecting tubules, there was only one phaseof enhanced amino-acid uptake, with amaximum on the 4th day, also coincidingwith an increased mitotic index.  theincrease of the number of cells of the kidneywas determined by a study of the variationsof the mitotic index.  the meanmultiplication factor in the beginning amountsto 1.6.  the protein metabolism is increased1.3 times.  the increase of the volume(factor 1.3) and the increase of the proteinmetabolism per unit of volume (factor 1.3)of the hypertrophic kidney result in atotal increase of the protein metabolismof 2.1 times, once the adaptation processis complete, so that the residual kidneyhas approximately the same proteinmetabolism as 2 normal kidneys.

studies in perfusion hypothermia with special reference to /deephypothermia/ and circulatory arrest .1. perfusion hypothermia produces large temperature gradients withinthe body since organs are cooled roughly in proportion to their basalblood flows . the difference between the coldest and the warmest portionof the body after 30 minutes of perfusion exceeds 25 c .2. the average body temperature, which provides a proper measure oftotal body cooling, may be calculated from the arteriovenous temperaturedifference and the extracorporeal flow rate .3. true /deep/ hypothermia is not obtainable by reasonable periods ofperfusion alone .4. an important rise of core temperatures occurs during circulatoryarrest in hypothermia because of relatively high average bodytemperature .5. high average body temperatures lead to continuing production oflactic acid in muscle tissue, whereas low core temperatures impairlactic acid metabolism . thus metabolic acidosis is progressive inprolonged perfusion hypothermia, and is accentuated by total circulatoryarrest . progressive acidosis may be minimized by uniform profoundcooling by combining external with perfusion hypothermia .6 diluents appear to have little effect on total body heat exchangeduring perfusion cooling .7. perfusion warming has a differentially greater effect on coreorgans . though these are readily brought to a normal range, much of theanimal may remain cold .

insulin and protein metabolismthe present status of protein synthesis within cells hasbeen outlined.  protein is formed in the absence of insulin;the net formation of protein is accelerated by insulin.  theeffects of insulin on protein metabolism take place independentlyof the transport of glucose or amino acids into thecell; of glycogen synthesis; and of the stimulation of highenergy phosphate formation.  in the case of protein metabolism,as in certain studies on the pathways of glucose andfat metabolism, these observations reveal striking intracellulareffects of insulin in many tissues.  within mosttissues the effect of insulin appears to find expression predominantlyat the microsomal level.  incidentally, otherhormones which affect protein metabolism such as growthor sex hormones appear to act at the microsomes.  the factthat insulin exerts effects on protein metabolism at otherintracellular sites as well as the above independent effectsleads one to agree that its action consists of a stimulationof multiple, seemingly unrelated, metabolic events.the fact that an immediate effect of insulin on proteinsynthesis is independent of the immediate need for extracellularglucose or amino acids does not mean that thesustained functioning of cells is likewise independent.  thebiochemist is fully aware of metabolic defects in diabeteswhich are not altered by insulin in vitro, but which demandvarying periods of pretreatment of the animal.  it isalso known that in diabetes some proteins (enzymes) maybe deficient while others may be produced in excess in theabsence of insulin.it is suggested that the physician desires at least twokinds of relation between these fundamental studies and hispatients.  one is the possible relation of a deficiency of insulinaction to pathological processes in tissues which havenot as yet been examined by the methods described.  theother is the need for more accurate measurements of themetabolic disorder and its control than such things asurinary and blood glucose.  in developing such future improvements,the place of insulin in protein biosynthesismust be kept in mind.

ribonuclease activity in hepatic nuclei during developmentmammalian liver undergoes marked qualitative and quantitative changesduring the development from the embryonic to the adult stage.  many of theseevents are associated with the derepression or repression of certain enzymeswhich may be related to specialized subcellular activity.  the involvementof ribonucleic acid in the transcription of the information from the genomeinto the construction of a finished protein molecule has prompted a study ofbiosynthesis of the rna during differentiation.  although considerable effortin this regard has been expended in amphibian1-5 and avian6,7 systems, as wellas in the sea urchin8-11, a paucity of literature exists with mammalian liver.accordingly, an investigation of the alterations in rna metabolism whichoccur during the development of the rat embryonic liver has been undertaken.this report concerns the fluctuations in nuclear ribonuclease during hepaticdevelopment and some of the properties of the enzyme.

parathyroid extract-induced changes in the oxidation of citrate,succinate and other organic acids by liver.parathyroid extract (pte) or partiallypurified parathyroid hormone administered invivo markedly altered the oxidationin vitro by rabbit liver minces of citrate, -ketoglutarate-c, succinate-c, fumarate-cand lactate.  with ca ++ present in theincubation medium, minces from ptetreated animals produced more co and hada greater o consumption than did controlminces.  this stimulation was due, in partat least, to a more rapid decline in metabolicactivity of the control tissues.  whenca++ was absent, total metabolism wasincreased and the tissue derived from ptetreated animals was less active than thecontrol tissue.  the effect was detected asearly as 4 hr after injection (750 u/kg)and could be elicited with as little as 200 u(at 14 hr).  the action of pte could notbe duplicated by the injection of cacl intothe animal.  the data suggest that one effectof treatment was a general inhibition ofoxidation.  the stimulation of metabolismcould be a consequence of this inhibitionor a separate unrelated alteration.

effects of parathyroid hormone and other proteins in vitroon mitochondrial metabolismit is apparent that in addition to parathyroid hormone, severalnon-hormonal basic proteins stimulate mitochondrial respiration, iontransport, and atpase, but inhibit the 32pi-atp exchange reaction.thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biologicalactions of parathyroid hormone as the previous reports suggested.rasmussen et al. (1964) have also isolated from parathyroidextracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrialtransport of phosphate in vitro.  they postulated that this proteinmight be yet another biologically important factor produced by para-thyroid glands.  the latter speculation may not be warranted in viewof the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria.  allof our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroidproteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically,or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone.further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determinewhether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validlyreflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is soundto use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.

comparison of ultraviolet sensitivity of bacillus subtilis bacteriophagespo2 and its infectious dna .deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from a clear plaque mutant of thetemperate phage, spo2, was infectious when incubated with competentcultures of bacillus subtilis 168 m . the relationship between numbersof infectious centers and dna concentration was linear .the sensitivity of the infectious dna to ultraviolet light was muchgreater than that of the free phage when b. subtilis 168 m was used ashost . acriflavin, which inhibits host cell reactivation, increased therate of ultraviolet inactivation of the free phage so that it approachedthe inactivation rate of the phage dna . acriflavin had little effect onthe survival curves of the infectious dna .non-host reactivating mutants (hcr ) of b. subtilis 168 m wereisolated . the survival curves of spo2 phage were much steeper when thehcr mutant was used as a host than those obtained when the hcr parentalstrain was used as a host .ultraviolet sensitivity of the phage dna was still greater than thatof the free phage even when b. subtilis hcr was used as host, but thedifference in sensitivity was much less than the difference obtainedwith b. subtilis hcr as a host .possible explanations for the greater ultraviolet sensitivity of theinfectious dna are discussed .

the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat containscharacteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures butbasically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limitingmembrane of the unit type .inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradationwhich occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . someinclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presentedsuggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involvedin the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associatedwith the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusionbodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge byaccretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolarspace . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater numberlate in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when thecuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattenedtype . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusionbodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it isconcluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active duringremodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonarysurfactant is discussed .
