the speech and language abilities ofemotionally disturbed childrenthe speech and language disorders ofthese severely disturbed children can bedivided into two categories which relateto the type of psychiatric disturbance.the autistic-schizophrenic children usedbizarre forms of language or did not usecommunicative language at all.  the non-autistic-schizophrenic, the neurotic, theprimary behaviour disorder, and theminimally brain-damaged children as agroup, had similar speech and languageproblems to normal children but of amore severe and frequent nature.  theirproblems were predominantly in theareas of speech and language develop-ment, articulation, rate of speech andfluency.  the children with primary be-haviour disorders had the more severespeech and language problems.

cognitive functioning in early infantile autism: an examination of four casesby means of the wechsler intelligence scale for childrenthe results are communicated which were obtained from an examination,by means of the wechsler intelligence scale for children, of four cases ofearly infantile autism.  these cases had developed in such a way that areliable investigation by means of a mental test had become possible.according to their full scale iq's the four cases fell within the category ofdull normal intelligence or less.  all of them showed a considerablediscrepancy between the verbal and the performance iq, the performance iq beingof much higher value.  the composition of the autistic test profiles wascharacterized by a large variability in the subtest scores, discriminating theautistic group significantly from non-autistic control groups.  the subtestscore divergencies, responsible for the large variability, showed a distinctpattern, being specific for the autistic group as a whole.  this group couldbe considered as a distinct group particularly by a marked tendency to achievepoorly and far below the subject's average level in the subtests comprehensionand vocabulary, and to achieve superiorly and far above that level in thesubtests block design and object assembly.  by specifying the mental functions,conditional for success in these four subtests that occupy extreme positionswithin the autistic test profiles, it was concluded that the autistic patientsapparently were able to achieve well, or even superiorly, only if the taskcould be performed on a purely perceptual level.  but they failed as soon asan appeal was made to thinking proper.  this was thought to be due to adisability in dealing with imaginary things and imaginary situations, or,in other words, to an incapability to objectify what is not actually presentin the subject's concrete situation.  it is proposed that this impairmentcould be reduced to a lack of symbolic means, being the correlate of adefective or insufficiently developed language in the patients.  it is furtherproposed that children suffering from earlyinfantile autism might not be able,or at a later stage only, to reach that level of language development in whichwords can be used as symbols,representing absent things and absent situations.

the applicability of individualized programed instructionin the education of deaf children.verbal behavior is learned behavior and assuch is guided by the same principlesas any other learned behavior.  the parents'role is mainly to help the young deafchild conceive of language as a socializingprocess and to help shape language behaviortoward the use of verbal symbols.the teacher's role in the deaf child'sprogress as a language user includes (1) helpingthe child discover how the structureof his language operates and (2) guidinghim in the process of acquiring clearconcepts.  the learning of a language is a highlyindividualized process and requiresthousands of hours of practice.  efficiencyin language teaching to the deafhas not been generally achieved by traditionalmethods.  the teacher of the deafneeds extra help in order to provide the individualistickind of teaching to insureverbal over-learning by the child.  self-tutoringprogramed materials offer thishelp.  programs are so constructed that a childproceeds through the program stepby step with a probability of maximum successbecause of constant feedback as tocorrectness of his responses.  for youngerchildren the use of a machine seemsdesirable while for older children the programmay appear in book form, on filmstrip, and any other visual medium.  well constructedprograms should be correlatedwith classroom instruction.

the development of social attachments in infancy .this report is devoted to the formation and development of socialattachments in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachmentfunction is represented by the tendency of the young to seek theproximity of certain other members of the species and that the mostsuitable operational definition may be found in the behavior of theindividual when deprived of such proximity .the study takes the form of a longitudinal follow-up, in which 60infants were investigated at four-weekly intervals from the early weekson up to the end of the first year and again at 18 months of age . withthe use of an attachment scale, based on seven everyday separationsituations, the following three main parameters were explored.. the ageat onset of specific attachments, the intensity of such attachments, andthe number of objects to whom attachments are formed . a measure offear-of-strangers was also included .results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments isgenerally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but thatthis is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. thatthe intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first monthfollowing onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individualcases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicityof objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of thespecific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remainingcases very soon thereafter . correlations between the attachmentvariables, as well as with the fear-of-strangers measure, are presented,and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest atproximity loss, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of theconditions necessary to terminate protest .individual differences with regard to the three main parameters wereexplored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables wereexamined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestionsmade regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of theattachment function .the data are discussed in relation to four themes which emerged fromthe findings.. the nature of the attachment function, its developmentalorigins, its developmental trends, and the influence of the socialsetting .

the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat containscharacteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures butbasically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limitingmembrane of the unit type .inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradationwhich occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . someinclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presentedsuggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involvedin the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associatedwith the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusionbodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge byaccretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolarspace . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater numberlate in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when thecuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattenedtype . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusionbodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it isconcluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active duringremodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonarysurfactant is discussed .

on language disorders in young children: a reorganization of thinkingcurrent questions and confusions aboutthe use of the term aphasia with referenceto young children seem often toreflect semantic problems accruingfrom professional habits of thinking interms of etiologic and pathologic labels.it is argued that if the term aphasia isgeneralized simply to refer to inabilitiesor interferences in the development oflanguage comprehension and use, thenit is the task of an evaluating group todescribe as well as possible, and in detail,the specific impairments of functionin each child.  this task commonlyrequires the use of an extensive periodof "diagnostic teaching," wherein careis taken to explore which sensory andmotor modalities are working andwhich are not, and whether integrationof various stimuli is taking place.some current ideas are discussed withreference to descriptions of impairment,causal factors that are fairly unique inchildhood, some thoughts about theneurophysiology of the human "languagesystem," and some psychosocialfactors important for language-learning.special attention is given to various relations,in terms of temporal resolvingpower, between sensation and sensoryintegration.  a scheme, or model, is suggestedwhich may prove fruitful forexperimental design in attacking someof these problems at a prelanguage orpremeaning level.  it is argued that theproportion of "unknowns" can be reducedby careful study based on informationabout impaired functions within the sensory-integrative-motor complex,without particular regard for "site andextent of lesion."

(3) specific type, presentingthe picture of cholangiolitis.histological changes in the liver other than biliarystasis were scanty.  no specificchanges which could clinically differentiate the3 types were found.  in each type,serum bilirubin, sgot and sgpt activities hadslight characteristic points in clinicaland laboratory studies.  in type 1, the valueswere relatively low, while in type2 they were markedly high.  in type 3, sgot activitywas within normal range.  histologicalcharacteristics of the liver of type 1were necrosis of liver cells, formationof acidophilic granules and balloon cells,cellular infiltration in glisson's capsule,and biliary stasis in the liver cells andfine bile ducts.  morphologically, findingsof viral hepatitis were observed.  in type2 liver tissue was replaced by manymultinuclear giant cells.  extreme distortionof cords of liver cells and cellular infiltrationin glisson's capsule and lobules werenoted.  there was marked biliarystasis in the capillary bile ducts and liver cells.it was characteristic that proliferationof bile ducts and bile plugs were not found,which was consistent with giantcell hepatitis of craing-landing.  in type 3, degenerationof liver cells, necrosisand inflammatory changes were slight.  biliarystasis in the hepatic lobules was conspicuous.histological findings similar to cholangiolitichepatitis due to drug poisoningwere observed.

long-term prognosis and the response of schizophrenic childrento drug therapy: a controlled study of trifluoperazine.it is evident from this study that treatment andcontrol groups must be matched for severity of illness,since this affects the responsiveness to pharmacologicalas well as to other types of treatments.  the use ofthe double-blind technique does not of itself guaranteea well-controlled study; the comparison of 2 or moretreatment regimes may be misleading if the groups arenot matched, or if the matching is not based on criticalfactors.  in this study, both the response to the nonpharmacologicaspects of treatment and the type ofresponse to the drug itself were related to the initialseverity of language impairment.  thus the major developmentaldefect which determines long-term outcomefor schizophrenic children in this group also predictedthe immediate responsiveness to treatment.  within the2 major prognostic subgroups of young schizophrenicchildren, those with speech and those without, are childrenwith different profiles of disordered developmentand different patterns of assets and handicaps.

acquisition of languagealthough the work of bullowa, jones, and bever has some of its greatestpromise in the light it may shed on the development of functions of languagein children, the promise cannot be realized unless the authors givea great deal of explicit attention to the framework of such analysis, for thereis not, as may be the case for phonological and grammatical development,anything like a satisfactory body of linguistic theory and method as to theterminal state.  while a good deal may be learned without such a theory, andnecessarily must be so learned, since the work in progress cannot be suspendeduntil such an unpredictable millenium, it still would be a pity if thechance were lost for the interaction of the acquisition of data and theimprovement of theoretical notions.let me complete my discussion by developing my argument in twoways: (a) by briefly stating the nature of the problem with regard to theterminal state of verbal development, (b) and by indicating what presentand future contribution such fields as anthropology, sociology, and socialpsychology may be able to make to the solution of the problem.

a light and electron microscope study of developing respiratory tissuein the rat .1. light microscopic observations on the development of the rat lunghave shown the presence of glandular, canalicular and alveolar stages .2. these same three stages can be identified by electron microscopyand all may be present in different parts of the lung at one time, e.g.at 40 and 45 mm. c.r. length .3. in the glandular stage, the lung tissue itself has an immatureappearance by light microscopy and by electron microscopy individualcells also are immature in respect of organelles . glycogen is presentin immature cells .4. during the canalicular stage, lung tissue becomes more vascular .5. throughout all stages of development, the 'duct' or 'air' spacesare always lined by a continuous and complete epithelium, and bloodvessels by a complete endothelium .6. lamellated inclusion bodies are present in epithelial (endodermal)cells at an early stage of development .7. micropinocytotic vesicles are present in large numbers in bothepithelial and endothelial cytoplasm and it is suggested that in thefoetus they may indicate absorption of amniotic fluid from alveolarspaces .8. the mechanism of alveolar distension is discussed and its natureremains uncertain .9. respiratory tissue of the rat is not fully differentiated at birthand the importance of this fact in human infants is discussed .10. the adult blood-air barrier, consisting of epithelium, zonadiffusa and endothelium, varies in thickness .this project was performed whilst both of us were in receipt of grantsfrom the medical research council of canada, for which gratitude isexpressed . our gratitude is also expressed to miss sylvia smith fortyping the manuscript .

early infantile autism and receptor processesthe syndrome of early infantile autism is examinedas a function of deviation innear-distance receptor usage.  these receptordeviations are compared with normalreceptor hierarchies developing from nearto distance receptor dominance.  theavailable information is consistent with theview that early infantile autism involvesearly sensory deprivation.  this sensorydeprivation results from an interactionbetween a constitutional deficiency inhibitingcertain reticular arousal functionsand mothering tending to understimulation.treatment of the young autistic child is suggestedincluding stimulation and communicationvia the available near receptorsystems.  in the framework of sensory development,directions for the study of earlydiagnosis and treatment are indicated.

impaired development of rat liver enzyme activities atbirth after irradiation in uterodevelopment of activity of three liver enzymes at birth was studied in rats re-ceiving 180 rads of x-rays on day 15 of gestation.  at 20 days of gestation,activities of lactic and glycerophosphate dehydrogenases andglucose-6-phosphatase were not altered.  the subsequent increases in enzymeactivities in the 3 days between 20 days of gestation and 1 day of age wereonly 30 to 60% of those observed in controls.  this finding suggests thatirradiation in utero may alter later development of enzyme activity in theperinatal period.

the autistic child in the school and theschool-nurse teacher responsibilityautistic children demonstrate a more persistent pattern of retreatingfrom reality than is apparent in those children categorized as normal.some psychologists have established the cause of symptoms in the autisticchild as extreme anxiety which forces withdrawal from social contact.such anxiety is reported to have its initial occurrance during the agerange of one to five years.  a sense of security which is considered es-sential for a child is gained through overt manifestations of love, care andapproval of those adults most closely associated with him.  when thisneed is not satisfied, the child's attempts at self-realization and esteemare deterred or thwarted, and a state of anxiety may result.  the severityof the anxiety may be the forerunner of a schizophrenic disorder.  sucha condition can develop in a child, an adolescent or an adult.  schizo-phrenia, a serious mental illness, is considered to be a major cause foradmitting patients to mental institutions.another school of thought has placed infantile autism in the categoryof a disturbance resulting from abnormalities of development during theintrauterine period.  such a congenital condition is not categorized asmental retardation.yet another concept of autism conceives of the problem as the absenceof an innate ability or capacity for developing meaningful contacts withother people.  a detachment of varying degrees persists where humancontacts are concerned.

studies on growth hormone secretionin rats with the hypophysis autotransplantedto the kidney capsulethe secretory capacity of the pituitary gland, autotransplanted to thekidney capsule, was studied with special regard to the secretion of growthhormone (gh).  body weight, body length, tibial epiphyseal width andthe mammary gland development after testosterone stimulation werestudied.body growth and tibial epiphyseal width were markedly reduced in therats with transplanted hypophysis, but not as much as in the hypophys-ectomized controls.  after injections of 0.25 mg testosterone propionatedaily for 10 days, only a few groups of alveoli were seen in the mam-mary glands of the transplanted rats.  these observations show that thereis a considerable deficiency of gh in rats with the pituitary gland auto-transplanted to the kidney capsule.  however, the development of a fewalveoli in the mammary glands is in favour of the theory that a smallamount of gh is secreted from the transplanted pituitary tissue.injections of a purified vasopressin preparation (pitressin) in the ratswith autotransplanted hypophysis did not influence body growth, tibialepiphyseal width or mammary gland development.  further, no effect ofpitressin was seen on the tibial epiphyseal cartilage of rats with intactpituitary gland as has been reported by del vecchio et al. (1958) andhiroshige & itoh (1960).  these experiments therefore do not support theview that vasopressin acts as a gh releasing factor.

phospholipids of the sexual segment of the kidney of theindian house lizard, hemidactylusflaviviridis ruppellthe indian house lizard, hemidactylus flaviviridis breeds seas-onally.  in a sexually mature male lizard, from october tomay of the following year, the secondary and tertiary collectingtubules of the kidney are hypertrophied forming the sexual seg-ment.  the development of the sexual segment is synchronous withthe testicular cycle and maximum development occurs during theperiod when the testes are spermatogenically active.  the sex-ual segment is not developed in the females in any season of theyear; it is completely regressed in males during sexual quiescence(june and july).  injection of 4.0 mg of testosterone propionateover two weeks stimulated the regressed sexual segment to hyper-trophy in males during quiescence and also in females.  theapical portions of the cells of the sexual segment are loadedwith granular secretions which are stained with baker's acid hae-matein and phosphomolybdic acid-stannous chloride, indicating thepresence of choline - containing phospholipids.  the composi-tion of the phospholipids of the sexual segment, which is a uniquefeature of the lizards and snakes, is unknown.  this preliminarycommunication describes the isolation and quantitative estimationof phospholipids present in the sexual segment of the indian houselizard, hemidactylus flaviviridis ruppell.

experiments on the contribution of somatotrophin to prenatal growth in the rathypophyseoprivus in a fetal rat induced by decapitating the fetus in uteroretards fetal growth.  this effect can be prevented by injected somatotrophin.these observations substantially support the view that in the normal ratshortly before birth the fetal somatotrophin from the developing hypophysisgoverns in part the prenatal growth which occurs at that time.  althoughcomplete hypophysectomy of a pregnant rat retardsthe growth of fetuses, the mannerof its action is obscure.  in an individual litter, combined hypophysectomyof the mother and hypophyseoprivus in a fetus retards fetal growth but notto any greater extent than hypophysectomy of the mother withouthypophyseoprivus in the fetus.  in the intact fetus injections of somatotrophin(armour) do not accelerate fetal growth, presumably because ample fetalsomatotrophin from the developing hypophysis is present.

ribonuclease activity in hepatic nuclei during developmentmammalian liver undergoes marked qualitative and quantitative changesduring the development from the embryonic to the adult stage.  many of theseevents are associated with the derepression or repression of certain enzymeswhich may be related to specialized subcellular activity.  the involvementof ribonucleic acid in the transcription of the information from the genomeinto the construction of a finished protein molecule has prompted a study ofbiosynthesis of the rna during differentiation.  although considerable effortin this regard has been expended in amphibian1-5 and avian6,7 systems, as wellas in the sea urchin8-11, a paucity of literature exists with mammalian liver.accordingly, an investigation of the alterations in rna metabolism whichoccur during the development of the rat embryonic liver has been undertaken.this report concerns the fluctuations in nuclear ribonuclease during hepaticdevelopment and some of the properties of the enzyme.

twins discordantfor early infantile autisma pair of heterozygous twins discordantfor early infantile autism is reported and therelevant literature reviewed.  although mani-fest organic factors were ruled out, the twins'physical development was different.  a spe-cific emotional etiology was not demon-strated.  the few available twin studies offerfindings consistent with the hypothesis thatgenetic factors are relevant to the develop-ment of childhood autism.  evidence is alsopresented that impaired acquisition of lan-guage may have hereditary determinants.a second set of probably homozygoustwins are reported who were also discordantfor autism.  this second case suggests that,although genetic factors may play a part, insome cases the syndrome of infantile autismappears to be a reversible one.  in view ofthis set of twins and of kanner's sibling data,the role of genetic factors remains obscure,and more twin studies properly documentedwith blood typing are needed.

375. hemianopsia and glaucomaafter a discussion of the bibliographic references to the few observations onthe simultaneous occurrence of hemianopsias and glaucoma the author states onthe basis of his experiences the following points  homonymous hemianopsiasoccasionally take place in glaucoma, although no direct relation can beestablished between the former and the glaucoma.  it has to be pointed out,however, that in other older patients, for example in those with retinaldetachment, neuritis, etc. who are likewise subjected to repeated and exactperimetry, such hemianopsias do not occur, or are to be found at a lesser ratethan in glaucoma.  a homonymous hemianopsia has to be taken into considerationalso in the event of a sudden impairment of the visual field in a glaucomatouspatient or when the hemianopic defect supervenes in addition to the visualfield defect due to glaucoma.  in cases of binasal hemianopsia, thesimultaneous presence of glaucoma is not a rare incident.  whether thebinasal hemianopsia is the result of the gradual development of aglaucomatous visual field with nasal defects or whether it constitutes anindependent symptom to a certain extent, cannot always be clarifiedin the individual case.  obviously the condition of the basal cerebralvessels plays a certain role in the development of glaucoma, even ifthis role cannot be clearly defined as yet.  in cases ofbinasal hemianopsia, a glaucoma has to be ruled out before radical diagnosticand therapeutic measures are carried out.

studies on eperythrozoon infection in sheepthe intravenous inoculation of blood from sheep in the parasi-taemic stage of eperythrozoon infection produced detectableparasitaemia in recipient sheep within 7 days.  the parasitaemialasted from 3 to 12 weeks and was accompanied by anaemia andoccasionally by icterus.  no other symptoms developed and in acontrolled experiment on hoggs there was no significant differencein weight gain between infected and control animals.a concurrent attack of tick-borne fever led to the disappearanceof eperythrozoon from the circulating blood.  it is suggested that thisphenomenon may be caused by the pyrexia.the incubation period following the inoculation of infected bloodin ten 3 to 4 week old lambs varied from 3 to 6 weeks.  in eight ofthese animals the symptoms were less severe than in adult sheep, butthe two smallest lambs developed a profound anaemia and failed togain weight.culture of the organism on sheep blood agar or on sheep kidneymonolayers was unsuccessful as was the attempted transmission ofthe infection to mice.the transference of keds and lice from infected to uninfectedsheep failed to transmit the infection, but a sheep was infected by theintravenous inoculation of ground-up lice from an infected animal.the only characteristic histopathological changes in infectedsheep were lymphoid hyperplasia of the malphigian corpuscles in thespleen and deposition of haemosiderin in the cells of the proximalconvoluted tubules in the kidney cortex.

evaluation and treatment planningfor autistic childreninfantile autism is considered to be a re-action on the part of an immature organismat a primitive and undifferentiated stage ofego development.  little choice of defensivereactions is available; the possibility of sub-limation does not exist and, even thoughother object relationships are graduallydeveloping, the mother is still the child'sprimary object.  at this vulnerable develop-mental stage, a wide range of pathologicalcircumstances, ranging from the most severefamily psychopathology to the most adventi-tious physiological traumata or the most un-fortunately malignant circumstances, mayconstitute an acute or cumulative cata-strophic stress.  the primitive organismtends to respond to this overwhelming stresswith a paranoid reaction which is directed atthe mother (regardless of the actual etiologi-cal variables) because the mother is still thechild's primary object.  we believe that thechild then responds with an autistic reactionand shows varying degrees of simple with-drawal, obsessional behavior, magical or de-lusional thought processes, and consequentdisruption of developmental skills, speech,and relationships with others.many families can and do make everyeffort to counter the paranoid reaction of thechild and do not respond to his rejection withcounterrejection and counterwithdrawal.some of the child's autistic symptoms mayabate without formal treatment.  yet, sincethe mother (and family) are the primaryobjects of the child's paranoid attitude, it isfelt that formal therapeutic intervention isnecessary to modify the paranoid core ofthe autistic reaction.

2431. the natural history of arrhythmias following septal defect reapirthe repair of 191 atrial and ventricular septaldefects between 1955 and 1961 wasreviewed to determine the incidence and prognosisof arrhythmias related to operation.cases included 90 ventricular septal defects, 61atrial defects of the ostium secundumtype, and 40 of the ostium primum variety.nodal rhythms, second degree blocks,complete heart block, and flutter or fibrillation thatpersisted after completion of operationwere analyzed, while intermittent ectopic beats,sinus tachycardia, and bundle branchblocks were excluded.  fifteen per cent of thepatients with ventricular defects, 17%with ostium primum defects, and 35% with ostiumsecundum defects developed abnormalrhythms associated with repair.  of 18 patients whosearrhythmias began during operation,there were 8 deaths; no fatalities occurred in the 24patients who developed arrhythmiasin the postoperative period.  seven deaths wereassociated with complete heart block andone with second degree block.  although only onehalf of the patients who developedarrhythmias had pulmonary artery pressure greaterthan 30 mm. hg systolic, all fatalitiesoccurred in this group.  four of the deaths followedsurgery with the use of the pumpoxygenator in children under 30 months of age.thirty-eight per cent of the abnormalrhythms that began in the postoperative periodwere nodal.  flutter and fibrillationwere common following repair of atrial secundumdefects in patients over 15 yr. of agebut did not occur in younger patients.  deaths fromheart block occurred in the first 30 daysfollowing operation except one, 5 months later.survivors of complete heart block revertedto a less serious arrhythmia or normal rhythmwithin 3 months.

speech and reading problems in childhood.the following communicative disordershave been discussed: functional articulationdefects, delayed speech development,stuttering, hearing loss, cleft palate,neurological disorders, and reading disorders.these disorders rarely have asingle cause.  they are the result of anintermingling of many factors, some physiologicaland some psychological, someresiding within the child and some in theparents and environment in general.  delayedor defective speech is a cause forgreat concern to most parents and teachers.the public health worker who listenswith an attentive and sympathetic ear mayallay some of this anxiety and thus helpfoster healthy emotional development inthe child.  the existence of a more seriouscondition underlying the presenting communicationproblem, even if sensed by theparents, is frequently denied.  the publichealth worker can assist the parents inthe painful process of facing up to theirfears.  a child with a communication problemis still a child and the public health workerby simply reflecting this to the parentsand advising them on normal child-raisingpractices can, again, be of help to thechild.  children with speech deviations areexposed to an overabundance of well-intentionedspeech correction at home.most of it is ineffective; some of it, unfortunatelyis harmful.  while the workermay not be in a position to offer specificadvice on a particular child, the mannerin which the parents and teacher are handlingthe child's communication problemcan be explored and damaging practicespossibly eliminated.  the fact that theremay be a diagnostic and treatment centerto which the child can be referred doesnot vitiate the public health worker's role.the public health physician and public healthnurse have a valuable contributionto make in helping the parents, school,and child accept the chronic nature of the disorder.

growth hormone and diabetes mellitussince the advent of insulin the vascular and neurologicallesions have replaced ketoacidosis as the majorproblem in diabetes.  although good control of hyperglycemiaand glycosuria with diet and insulin mayinfluence favorably the development of the ocular angiopathy,there remains a high incidence of theselesions with resulting blindness despite such goodcontrol.growth hormone may be a major factor in thepathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and its effectsmay be a reflection of the genetic disturbance.  its importancewas first realized by the classical experimentsof houssay and those of young which revealed itsdiabetogenic effects in experimental animals.  the associationof acromegaly with diabetes has been for along time the major argument in support of the hypothesisof the diabetogenic effect of growth hormonein man.

postnatal changes in the portal circulationduring foetal development a large portion of theoxygenated umbilical blood flows through theumbilical recess directly into both main portalbranches.  accordingly, these are exposed to theumbilical blood pressure and have a wideby contrast, the trunk of the portal vein is narrowand there is probably only a small blood flow throughit from the inactive digestive tract, though thepressure in it is approximately the same as in theumbilical vein or perhaps somewhat higher.immediately after birth the liver is deprived of thesubstantial umbilical blood flow.  the portalvenous pressure falls to about one-quarter of theumbilical venous pressure at birth.  however thepressure gradient between the portal veins andinferior vena cava remains constant.

color test for the measurement of antibody to t-strain mycoplasmas.a metabolic inhibition technique for the measurementof antibody to t-strain mycoplasmas was developed,based upon the ability of t-strain mycoplasmas tometabolize urea with the concomitant production of ammonia,and the ability of specific, antiserum to inhibitthis ammonia production.  phenol red added to themedium served as an indicator of ph change resultingfrom ammonia production.  specific antiserum to t-strainmycoplasma t-960 was prepared.  the t-strainorganism was shown to be serologically distinct from therecognized large-colony mycoplasmas.  antibody tomycoplasma strain t-960 in human sera was demonstratedwith the metabolic inhibition technique.

bilateral renal hypoplasia of the pig.bilateral renal hypoplasia of the pig is describedand is compared with a previousdescription.  the defect was observed in 19piglets out of a total of 73 born in 8litters, sired by one large white boar.twelve affected piglets died at or soonafter birth and 7 died between the ages of 11and 69 days.  inheritance by a simpleautosomal recessive factor is suggested bythe evidence.  grossly the conditionwas characterized by varying degrees ofhypoplasia and persistence of fetal lobulation.microscopically, the dominant featurewas the poor development of the collectingtubule system.  it is concluded thatthe basic defect is a failure of developmentof mesonephric mesenchyme.

the prevention of cripplingin haemophilic childrenchildren who are severely affected with haemo-philia or christmas disease suffer repeatedhaemorrhages into joints and muscles after trivialinjuries.  these episodes of bleeding producecumulative crippling.  the haemarthroses tend to berecurrent; each episode produces some damage tothe joint surface and the immobility during con-valescence leads to muscle weakness.  thus afterrecovery the joint becomes increasingly liable torenewed bleeding.  the deep muscle haematomatacan produce crippling by actual destruction ofmuscle tissue, by pressure on important nerves orarteries, by contractures which develop duringhealing and by failure of resolution of the originalhaematoma leading to chronic cyst formation.

the regulation of growth hormone secretionin the present communication we summarizeour investigations on the controlof secretion of hgh using radioimmunoassayfor the measurement of plasmagh. the assumption, implied throughout thispresentation, that changes insecretory rate are responsible for acutechanges in plasma concentration ofhgh appears reasonable since thefluctuations in plasma hgh concentrationare often too rapid to be caused solely byalterations in hormonaldegradation or excretion.  for slower changesin plasma hgh concentration,however, alterations in the rate of removalof hormone from the body fluidsmight play a contributory role.  however,there is no evidence that importantchanges occur in the rate of removal ofhgh from the circulation except inpatients who have developed antibodiesto hgh following treatment with hgh.

maternal anxiety during pregnancy and adequacy of mother and childadjustment eight months following childbirth .fifty pregnant women were administered a battery of psychologicaltests . on the basis of scores obtained from the manifest anxiety scale,these pregnant women were dichotomized into a /high anxiety/ group and a/low anxiety/ group . eight months following childbirth, the mothers andchildren were seen for a psychological assessment . it was found thatthe women in the /high anxious/ group evidenced significantly morenegative childrearing attitudes . that is, the /high anxious/ mothersobtained significantly higher scores on the hostility and controlfactors measured by the pari . on the basis of the examiner's ratings ofthe mother's personality traits, it was found that the women who werehighly anxious during pregnancy received much less favorable personalityratings at the time of the 8-month assessment . moreover, there was asignificant difference in the proportions of mothers in the two groupswho received a favorable rating from the examiner on the basis of hisobservation of the mother-child interaction during the session . instudying the children of these mothers, it was found that the childrenof the /low anxious/ mothers received a significantly higherdevelopmental quotient on the infant mental scale . in keeping with thisfinding, they also obtained a higher developmental quotient on the motorscale, although on this aspect of the intellectual assessment thedifference was not statistically significant . also, the children fromthe /low anxious/ mothers tended to receive a score indicative of a morefavorable general emotional tone than did the offspring of the /highanxious/ mothers . this difference between the two groups of childrenwas not statistically significant . in general, the findings wereconsistent with the predictions that the children who were being rearedby women who had been highly anxious during pregnancy would fare lesswell on tests of intellectual development and indices of emotionaladjustment . the findings also were in keeping with the prediction thatthe highly anxious women during pregnancy would evidence less desirableparental attitudes during their child's early development and that theywould present a less favorable personality picture at a timeapproximately 8 months following pregnancy .

isozymes of lactic dehydrogenase.. sequential alterations duringdevelopment .applications of isozymes in various biological contexts have beenreviewed . diagnosis of several disease states has been facilitated byexamination of the serum isozyme pattern which has been shown tocorrelate in some conditions with the isozyme pattern of pathologicallyinvolved tissues . physico-chemical studies of human ldh isozymes haverevealed differences among isozymes in affinity for a given substrate .comparative studies of ldh isozymes within the erythrocyte from variousvertebrate species demonstrated a marked species variation in the numberof ldh isozymes, in the distribution of total ldh activity among them,and in their electrophoretic mobilities . during development of chick,rabbit, and human tissues characteristic sequential alterations in theldh isozyme pattern occurred and consisted for liver and muscle in lossof the most rapidly migrating anodal bands and increased activity in thecathodal bands and slower migrating anodal bands . in heart the reversechanges were observed . if high enough ldh activities of early fetaltissue extracts were applied to the gel the full complement of ldhisozymes was observed,. however, in lower concentrations the cathodalbands, which in the starch gel disappear more rapidly on dilution thando the anodal bands, were not observed . a species-specific isozymepattern is obtained in long term culture of rabbit, chick, and humancells . independently of the tissue of origin, there occurs in cells inculture a sequential series of isozyme alterations characterized bydecreased intensity of rapidly migrating anodal bands . the shift towardprominence of cathodal isozymes during both fetal development and tissueculture can be explained by postulating the increased activity of thegene producing one of the subunits of ldh with a concomitant decrease inthe activity of the gene producing the second subunit . practicalapplications of the study of isozymes in tissue culture were discussed .

617. maturation of postnatal human lung and the idiopathic respiratory distresssyndromematuration and pathologic alterations of the lungin 19 newborn infants who died of idiopathic respiratorydistress syndrome were studied by light-and electronmicroscopy.  normal lungs from 6 fetuses and 11 new-borns served as controls.  in all infants with idiopathicrespiratory distress syndrome, respiratory bronchio-les and alveolar ducts usually presented the histologicpattern of mature lungs, i.e. they were predominantlylined by type i cells, which also formed the epithelialcomponent of most blood-air barriers.  well expandedalveoli exhibited a similar pattern, whereas collapsedalveoli were lined by numerous type ii cells which par-ticipated in the formation of poorly developed blood-airbarriers.  the capacity of type ii cells to produce in-clusion bodies seemed to increase with survival beyondthe 14th hr of age.  secretion of inclusion bodies andpresumably surfactant into alveolar spaces did occurbut only in the lungs of infants older than 2 days.  how-ever, this process was not accompanied by reductionin the number of type ii cells per alveolus as in the nor-mal lung.  the distribution of pathologic changes in idio-pathic respiratory distress syndrome appeared to bedetermined by the degree of maturity of the air sacs.structurally mature air sacs were associated with da-mage of epithelial lining and hyaline membrane forma-tion.  in contrast, collapsed alveoli revealed an intactepithelial lining and marked septal edema but were freeof hyaline membranes.  the findings of this study sug-gested that transudation of plasma through well develop-ed blood-air barriers was responsible for epithelialdamage and hyaline-membrane formation in air sacs.they also suggested that alveolar collapse and presuma-bly lack of surfactant were related to abnormal matura-tion of the epithelial lining and to septal edema.
