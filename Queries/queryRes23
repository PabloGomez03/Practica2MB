early infantile autism and receptor processesthe syndrome of early infantile autism is examinedas a function of deviation innear-distance receptor usage.  these receptordeviations are compared with normalreceptor hierarchies developing from nearto distance receptor dominance.  theavailable information is consistent with theview that early infantile autism involvesearly sensory deprivation.  this sensorydeprivation results from an interactionbetween a constitutional deficiency inhibitingcertain reticular arousal functionsand mothering tending to understimulation.treatment of the young autistic child is suggestedincluding stimulation and communicationvia the available near receptorsystems.  in the framework of sensory development,directions for the study of earlydiagnosis and treatment are indicated.

the problems of infantile autism and psychiatric nosology.in psychiatric literature the syndrome ofearly infantile autism has been dividedinto several subgroups (as, for instance,the subgroup of kanner and the subgroupof asperger) and has been assigned todifferent mental conditions (schizophrenia,psychopathy, neurosis).  these distinctionsand classifications are thought to becontroversial, so long as the etiology ofearly infantile autism is unknown.  norshould any 'psychiatric school' claim tohave the 'right' concept of schizophrenia,since the etiology of schizophrenia, too,has not yet been discovered.  in this particular'pre-scientific' situation of psychiatryit seems more promising to analyzethe individual mental case and to concentrateon clinical symptomatology insteadof discussing arbitrary 'nosological entities'.

twins discordantfor early infantile autisma pair of heterozygous twins discordantfor early infantile autism is reported and therelevant literature reviewed.  although mani-fest organic factors were ruled out, the twins'physical development was different.  a spe-cific emotional etiology was not demon-strated.  the few available twin studies offerfindings consistent with the hypothesis thatgenetic factors are relevant to the develop-ment of childhood autism.  evidence is alsopresented that impaired acquisition of lan-guage may have hereditary determinants.a second set of probably homozygoustwins are reported who were also discordantfor autism.  this second case suggests that,although genetic factors may play a part, insome cases the syndrome of infantile autismappears to be a reversible one.  in view ofthis set of twins and of kanner's sibling data,the role of genetic factors remains obscure,and more twin studies properly documentedwith blood typing are needed.

incidence of symptoms of early infantile autism insubsequently hospitalized psychiatric patientsthis study was concerned with therelationship between the occurrence dur-ing the first two years of life of symptomsof early infantile autism, as retrospective-ly reported by the mothers of s's andsubsequent adjustment.  the mothers of69 unmarried young hospitalized psychia-tric patients were interviewed to deter-mine the presence or absence of each of28 different signs contained in a checklist.  the signs represent characteristicfeatures that are reportedly often foundin conjunction with early infantile autism.as a control, 50 mothers of high schoolstudents residing in the community andpresenting no significant adjustment prob-lems were questioned in regard to thevery same items.the results indicated that there weresignificantly more symptoms reported forpatients than for normals, and that thisfinding applied to the overall number ofsymptoms as well as to several subcate-gories of symptoms.  the items classifiedunder the heading of "social withdrawal"appeared to be the most sensitive in dif-ferentiating the groups.  it was also foundthat 11 of the 28 signs distinguished be-tween the patients and normals, with allexcept one occurring more frequently inthe former group.  it was concluded thata significant relationship existed betweenthe reported presence of symptoms thatare often associated with severe and earlyego impairment and subsequent status asa mental hospital patient.  this study doesnot provide any direct answer to the ques-tion of what proportion of children withinfantile autism are later able to make anadequate adjustment outside of a mentalhospital.

infantile autism and the schizophreniasin a paper published in 1943, entitled "au-tistic disturbances of affective con-tact," i reported from the children's psychi-atric service of the johns hopkins hospitalobservations of 11 children (8 boys and 3girls) who had in common a pattern of be-havior not previously considered in itsstriking uniqueness.  the symptoms wereviewed as a combination of extreme alone-ness from the beginning of life and an anx-iously obsessive desire for the preservationof sameness.  i concluded the discussion bysaying: "we must assume that these chil-dren have come into the world with aninnate inability to form the usual, biologi-cally provided affective contact with people,just as other children come into the worldwith innate physical and intellectual handi-caps.  if this assumption is correct, a furtherstudy of our children may help to furnishconcrete criteria regarding the still diffusenotions about the constitutional componentsof emotional reactivity.  for here we seem tohave pure-culture examples of inborn au-tistic disturbances of affective contact."in my search for an appropriate designa-tion, i decided in 1944, after much groping,on the term early infantile autism, thusaccentuating the time of the first manifesta-tions and the children's limited accessibility.

cognitive functioning in early infantile autism: an examination of four casesby means of the wechsler intelligence scale for childrenthe results are communicated which were obtained from an examination,by means of the wechsler intelligence scale for children, of four cases ofearly infantile autism.  these cases had developed in such a way that areliable investigation by means of a mental test had become possible.according to their full scale iq's the four cases fell within the category ofdull normal intelligence or less.  all of them showed a considerablediscrepancy between the verbal and the performance iq, the performance iq beingof much higher value.  the composition of the autistic test profiles wascharacterized by a large variability in the subtest scores, discriminating theautistic group significantly from non-autistic control groups.  the subtestscore divergencies, responsible for the large variability, showed a distinctpattern, being specific for the autistic group as a whole.  this group couldbe considered as a distinct group particularly by a marked tendency to achievepoorly and far below the subject's average level in the subtests comprehensionand vocabulary, and to achieve superiorly and far above that level in thesubtests block design and object assembly.  by specifying the mental functions,conditional for success in these four subtests that occupy extreme positionswithin the autistic test profiles, it was concluded that the autistic patientsapparently were able to achieve well, or even superiorly, only if the taskcould be performed on a purely perceptual level.  but they failed as soon asan appeal was made to thinking proper.  this was thought to be due to adisability in dealing with imaginary things and imaginary situations, or,in other words, to an incapability to objectify what is not actually presentin the subject's concrete situation.  it is proposed that this impairmentcould be reduced to a lack of symbolic means, being the correlate of adefective or insufficiently developed language in the patients.  it is furtherproposed that children suffering from earlyinfantile autism might not be able,or at a later stage only, to reach that level of language development in whichwords can be used as symbols,representing absent things and absent situations.

the autistic child in the school and theschool-nurse teacher responsibilityautistic children demonstrate a more persistent pattern of retreatingfrom reality than is apparent in those children categorized as normal.some psychologists have established the cause of symptoms in the autisticchild as extreme anxiety which forces withdrawal from social contact.such anxiety is reported to have its initial occurrance during the agerange of one to five years.  a sense of security which is considered es-sential for a child is gained through overt manifestations of love, care andapproval of those adults most closely associated with him.  when thisneed is not satisfied, the child's attempts at self-realization and esteemare deterred or thwarted, and a state of anxiety may result.  the severityof the anxiety may be the forerunner of a schizophrenic disorder.  sucha condition can develop in a child, an adolescent or an adult.  schizo-phrenia, a serious mental illness, is considered to be a major cause foradmitting patients to mental institutions.another school of thought has placed infantile autism in the categoryof a disturbance resulting from abnormalities of development during theintrauterine period.  such a congenital condition is not categorized asmental retardation.yet another concept of autism conceives of the problem as the absenceof an innate ability or capacity for developing meaningful contacts withother people.  a detachment of varying degrees persists where humancontacts are concerned.

infantile autism: a family approachthe autistic child appears to be unable to integrate or to respond tostimuli, both from an internal source, the body, as well as from externalsources, such as human contact.  we have noted in the children at ourresidential treatment center how in their preliminary period with us theyappear to be unaware of their body; they give the impression of beinginsensitive to pain, display little autoerotic behavior, inflict injury onthemselves, such as hitting their heads against objects and biting their ownbodies, with little outward display of distress.  in working with thesechildren in therapy, one of the guideposts for change and for growth is adisplay on the child's part of an increased body awareness and autoeroticbehavior.  for example, one child who developed polio during his early stayat the clinic residence did not communicate this to anyone and it was onlymade known by observing the child's dragging one leg (memorial guid-ance clinic, 1959).  later, he was able to point to his body and to indicatepain.  another child, who at first seemed to be quite unaware of both himselfand others, concurrent with his growing display of affective expressiontoward the therapist also manifested pleasure through genital stimulation,was quite ticklish, and when injured would display the area of pain quitereadily.

autistic reactions in early childhood:differential diagnostic considerationsthe term "autism" is frequently used todayin the differential diagnosis of the severeemotional disturbances of early childhood.however, to label a child as "autistic"presents some formidable problems withregard to definition of the term, the specificetiological-diagnostic implications, andtreatment considerations for any givenchild so designated.  the purpose of thispaper is to briefly review some of thehistorical psychiatric background of the term"autism", its more recent ramifications,and our clinical experiences in this field.

the autistic childthe conditions most frequently mistakenfor autism are speech disorder, brain damageand mental deficiency, each a prominentsymptom of the psychotic child.  careful his-tory and close observation to disclose symp-toms of withdrawal, lack of ego, compulsionfor sameness, and displays of intelligencegive incomplete clues to the diagnosis.the etiology of autism is uncertain.  sev-eral factors seem significant.  the importantrole of organic damage of the brain is under-scored by the coincidence of epilepsy, eegand neurological abnormalities in these chil-dren.  in our series seizures of various typesoccurred in 25%, eeg abnormalities in 58%,and minor neurological deficits in 70% ofthe cases.  environmental factors are quiteobviously important in many instances.  theemotional and behavioral pattern of the par-ents toward the infant is often incriminated.separation, inattention, coldness, rejection,etc. have been found in many situations.  fa-milial incidence of psychoses is low; so isthat of autism in siblings.

a behavioural and electroencephalographicstudy of autistic childrenshort biographies are given of 10 children,age 3 to 6 years, diagnosed as suffering fromkanner's syndrome (early infantile autism).an analysis was made of the free-field acti-vities of these children compared with a groupof normal children of similar age.  electro-encephalographic studies were also carried outon all 10 children, and in two it was possibleto carry out simultaneous behavioural andeeg observations by means of telemetry.the children were observed for three minuteperiods in four environments of varyingcomplexity: a. an empty room; b. the sameroom with toy wooden blocks present; c.blocks plus passive adult; d. blocks plus activeadult.  except in a the visual fixations andmanipulatory activities were of significantlyshorter duration in the autistic children thanin the normals, lacked clear 'cut-off' pointsand showed relatively little variability betweenenvironments.  the autistic children as awhole showed virtually no constructive play incontrast with the normals, though moretime was spent in contact with play materials inthe social environments.  changes in thetime spent in locomotion, gesturing, block-playand manipulation of other objects in theenvironment showed that the autistic childrenwere acutely responsive to changes in theirenvironment, including the presence of the socialstimulus.  if the autistic children weresubdivided into those who characteristically showedstereotypies and those who did not, thelatter sub-group showed a behaviour structure whichwas very similar to that of the normals,whereas the stereotypy sub-group was clearlydifferentiated from both the normal childrenand the non-stereotypy sub-group.eight autistic children had waking eegrecords characterized by low voltage irregularactivity without any established rhythms;one child, a record containing irregular alphaand another unstable theta activity.  two ofthe children with 'flat' laboratory eegs showedmore rhythmic, higher voltage records whentheir eegs were telemetred in environment a.they also showed less stereotyped behaviour.in environments b and d they showed pro-gressively more irregular eeg activity andmore stereotypy.the hypothesis is advanced that autisticchildren are in a chronically high state of physio-logical arousal.  the findings of the presentstudy and those of other workers are discussedwith respect to this hypothesis.

families of children with early childhood schizophrenia.emotionally disturbed children were dividedinto 3 groups on the basis of theirdiagnoses of: (1) autism or symbiosis,(2) chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia,and (3) other forms of emotional disturbance.the 3 groups were compared statisticallyon the following demographic measures:(1) educational level of parents; (2)occupational level of father; (3) prevalenceof broken homes; (4) male-female ratioin each patient group; (5) ordinal positionamong siblings; (6) ordinal positionamong siblings of same sex; and (7) age ofparents at birth of child.  results indicatedthat families of children diagnosedas autistic or symbiotic show manysimilarities to those with the diagnosis ofchronic undifferentiated schizophrenia.in general, the parents in these 2 groupswere better educated and were employedin more highly rated occupations than parentsof otherwise disturbed subjects.broken homes were prevalent in the groupof disturbed nonschizophrenic children,but not in the autistic or chronic undifferentiatedschizophrenic groups.  the male-femaleratio was not significantly differentamong the 3 groups; in the autisticgroup, specifically, it was 2.8:1.  the datarevealed no trend in ordinal position.

on early infantile psychosis.the symbiotic and autistic syndromesin conclusion, i wish to state that thecore of child psychosis mustbe sought in one or the other of thedescribed distortions of the sym-biotic phase.  in the first case, what layat the heart of the psychotic dis-turbance was the marked emotionalunavailability of the mother,which alternated with a purely physicalextreme closeness during thebreast-feeding situations, and particularlywith the destructiveness ofthe mother's unpredictable rage attacks.the contrasting experiencesdrove the child to the autistic wardingoff of any human contact andthe de-animation of the world of reality.constitutional factors couldnot, in this case, be evaluated with anydegree of accuracy.in the second case, it was, by contrast,the mother's ever-presencethat created an unendurable instrusionupon and interference withthe structuralization of the budding ego,which constitutionally andperhaps predispositionally may have beenvery vulnerable.  this madeit impossible for the infant to experiencethe normal alternation ofthe gratification-frustration sequences athis own pace; it also madethe process of individuation in theseparation-individuation periodone which was beset with abysmal panic.in both instances, we can see that it wasprimarily in the severe dis-tortions of the normal symbiosis that thechild psychosis had its roots.

evaluation and treatment planningfor autistic childreninfantile autism is considered to be a re-action on the part of an immature organismat a primitive and undifferentiated stage ofego development.  little choice of defensivereactions is available; the possibility of sub-limation does not exist and, even thoughother object relationships are graduallydeveloping, the mother is still the child'sprimary object.  at this vulnerable develop-mental stage, a wide range of pathologicalcircumstances, ranging from the most severefamily psychopathology to the most adventi-tious physiological traumata or the most un-fortunately malignant circumstances, mayconstitute an acute or cumulative cata-strophic stress.  the primitive organismtends to respond to this overwhelming stresswith a paranoid reaction which is directed atthe mother (regardless of the actual etiologi-cal variables) because the mother is still thechild's primary object.  we believe that thechild then responds with an autistic reactionand shows varying degrees of simple with-drawal, obsessional behavior, magical or de-lusional thought processes, and consequentdisruption of developmental skills, speech,and relationships with others.many families can and do make everyeffort to counter the paranoid reaction of thechild and do not respond to his rejection withcounterrejection and counterwithdrawal.some of the child's autistic symptoms mayabate without formal treatment.  yet, sincethe mother (and family) are the primaryobjects of the child's paranoid attitude, it isfelt that formal therapeutic intervention isnecessary to modify the paranoid core ofthe autistic reaction.
