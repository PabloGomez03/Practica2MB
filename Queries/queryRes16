separation anxiety as a cause of early emotional problems in children .in summary, three cases of disturbed behavior in children have beendiscussed, with particular emphasis on disturbances in feeding,sleeping, and motility . some of the hypotheses have been presented ofwhy such behavior should develop,. the significance of attachmentbehavior and separation anxiety in infants has been particularlystressed . difficulties in mothering care are threatening to the child'ssense of security and lead to greater experience of separation anxiety,which may then be reflected in various disturbances or alterations inhis behavior . this experience of separation anxiety is the result ofearly life experience, may reach pathologic proportions, and may accountfor many later problems in children and adults .

1808. separation anxiety  a factor in the object relations ofschizophrenic patients.the thesis is advanced thatspecial vulnerability to separation anxiety is a crucialfactor in the schizophrenic's difficulty in establishingand maintaining satisfactory interpersonal relationships.2 major reasons for this are lack of autonomy and lackof object constancy.  without a stable autonomouscapacity for self-regulation and adaptation, he is inordi-nately dependent upon others for help, protection, anddirection.  without object constancy, he is unable tomaintain a stable representation of the needed person inthe latter's absence.  evidence is presented from theintensive psychotherapy of schizophrenic patients.many of the vicissitudes of the doctor-patient relation-ship center about the patient's separation anxiety andhis attempted defenses against it.  these include clinging,perceptual and cognitive distortions designed to denyseparation, and recourse to substitute objects.  promi-nent in many of these efforts is the attempt to reversepassive victimization into active mastery.  the practicalimplications of this thesis for the treatment of schiz-ophrenic patients are discussed.

changes in children's behavior after hospitalization some dimensions ofresponse and their correlates .changes in 387 children's behavior following hospitalization wereevaluated by means of a questionnaire sent to parents a week afterdischarge . factor analyses revealed that children's responses tohospitalization and illness were of six types.. (i) general anxiety andregression, (ii) separation anxiety, (iii) anxiety about sleep, (iv)eating disturbance, (v) aggression toward authority, and (vi)apathy-withdrawal . scores for these six factors (types of responses) aswell as a total score, were analyzed by univariate and, in most cases,multivariate analyses of variance . four variables -dash sex, priorhospitalization, degree of pain experienced during hospitalization, andbirth order -dash were essentially unrelated to any type of response byany analysis . age, duration of hospitalization, and occupational statuswere each significantly related to one or more types of responses .comparison of the mean factor and total scores for the full sample withthe levels indicative of no overall change indicated that thecombination of illness and hospitalization is a psychologicallyupsetting experience for children in general, resulting in increasedseparation anxiety, increased sleep anxiety, and increased aggressiontoward authority .

the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat containscharacteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures butbasically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limitingmembrane of the unit type .inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradationwhich occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . someinclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presentedsuggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involvedin the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associatedwith the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusionbodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge byaccretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolarspace . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater numberlate in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when thecuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattenedtype . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusionbodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it isconcluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active duringremodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonarysurfactant is discussed .

the autistic child in the school and theschool-nurse teacher responsibilityautistic children demonstrate a more persistent pattern of retreatingfrom reality than is apparent in those children categorized as normal.some psychologists have established the cause of symptoms in the autisticchild as extreme anxiety which forces withdrawal from social contact.such anxiety is reported to have its initial occurrance during the agerange of one to five years.  a sense of security which is considered es-sential for a child is gained through overt manifestations of love, care andapproval of those adults most closely associated with him.  when thisneed is not satisfied, the child's attempts at self-realization and esteemare deterred or thwarted, and a state of anxiety may result.  the severityof the anxiety may be the forerunner of a schizophrenic disorder.  sucha condition can develop in a child, an adolescent or an adult.  schizo-phrenia, a serious mental illness, is considered to be a major cause foradmitting patients to mental institutions.another school of thought has placed infantile autism in the categoryof a disturbance resulting from abnormalities of development during theintrauterine period.  such a congenital condition is not categorized asmental retardation.yet another concept of autism conceives of the problem as the absenceof an innate ability or capacity for developing meaningful contacts withother people.  a detachment of varying degrees persists where humancontacts are concerned.

maternal separation in the rhesus monkey .the present study involved separation of eight monkey mother-infantpairs for a period of two weeks and measurement of the behavior of theinfants before, during and after reunion with their mothers, and of themothers before and after reunion . all infants showed emotionaldisturbance in response to separation and drastic decreases in play andother complex social behaviors while separated .it is clear that infant-mother separation produces emotionaldisturbance in both human and macaque infants and that the patterns ofresponses following separation are similar in both species . the resultsobtained in studies of monkey infant-mother separation indicate thatsheer physical separation is the crucial aspect of maternal separationfor monkeys . undoubtedly other factors associated with separation fromthe mother are vitally important for human children, and may account inpart for the absence or rarity of the detachment stage (as seen in humanresponse pattern) in separated monkey infants . the overall results showconsiderable similarity in the responses of human children and infantmonkeys to separation from the mother .

maternal anxiety during pregnancy and adequacy of mother and childadjustment eight months following childbirth .fifty pregnant women were administered a battery of psychologicaltests . on the basis of scores obtained from the manifest anxiety scale,these pregnant women were dichotomized into a /high anxiety/ group and a/low anxiety/ group . eight months following childbirth, the mothers andchildren were seen for a psychological assessment . it was found thatthe women in the /high anxious/ group evidenced significantly morenegative childrearing attitudes . that is, the /high anxious/ mothersobtained significantly higher scores on the hostility and controlfactors measured by the pari . on the basis of the examiner's ratings ofthe mother's personality traits, it was found that the women who werehighly anxious during pregnancy received much less favorable personalityratings at the time of the 8-month assessment . moreover, there was asignificant difference in the proportions of mothers in the two groupswho received a favorable rating from the examiner on the basis of hisobservation of the mother-child interaction during the session . instudying the children of these mothers, it was found that the childrenof the /low anxious/ mothers received a significantly higherdevelopmental quotient on the infant mental scale . in keeping with thisfinding, they also obtained a higher developmental quotient on the motorscale, although on this aspect of the intellectual assessment thedifference was not statistically significant . also, the children fromthe /low anxious/ mothers tended to receive a score indicative of a morefavorable general emotional tone than did the offspring of the /highanxious/ mothers . this difference between the two groups of childrenwas not statistically significant . in general, the findings wereconsistent with the predictions that the children who were being rearedby women who had been highly anxious during pregnancy would fare lesswell on tests of intellectual development and indices of emotionaladjustment . the findings also were in keeping with the prediction thatthe highly anxious women during pregnancy would evidence less desirableparental attitudes during their child's early development and that theywould present a less favorable personality picture at a timeapproximately 8 months following pregnancy .

the development of social attachments in infancy .this report is devoted to the formation and development of socialattachments in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachmentfunction is represented by the tendency of the young to seek theproximity of certain other members of the species and that the mostsuitable operational definition may be found in the behavior of theindividual when deprived of such proximity .the study takes the form of a longitudinal follow-up, in which 60infants were investigated at four-weekly intervals from the early weekson up to the end of the first year and again at 18 months of age . withthe use of an attachment scale, based on seven everyday separationsituations, the following three main parameters were explored.. the ageat onset of specific attachments, the intensity of such attachments, andthe number of objects to whom attachments are formed . a measure offear-of-strangers was also included .results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments isgenerally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but thatthis is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. thatthe intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first monthfollowing onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individualcases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicityof objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of thespecific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remainingcases very soon thereafter . correlations between the attachmentvariables, as well as with the fear-of-strangers measure, are presented,and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest atproximity loss, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of theconditions necessary to terminate protest .individual differences with regard to the three main parameters wereexplored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables wereexamined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestionsmade regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of theattachment function .the data are discussed in relation to four themes which emerged fromthe findings.. the nature of the attachment function, its developmentalorigins, its developmental trends, and the influence of the socialsetting .

lesions of the liver in hereditarymetabolic diseaseswhether the various cells of the liver, both parenchymal and stromal,receive genetic misinformation in all hereditary diseases caused by genemutation is unknown, but the metabolic capabilities of these several celltypes are so diverse that it is not surprising that their involvement inmany such diseases can be demonstrated by clinical, pathological, or bio-chemical methods.  repetitive abnormality of the liver has apparently notbeen defined for any disease caused by quantitative (i.e., chromosomal)gene anomaly, whether produced by nondisjunction, translocation, ormajor deletion, perhaps because relatively few such diseases have beendescribed.  as a result, the genetically determined disorders of the liversurveyed in this paper appear to be the result of conventional "singlegene" abnormalities, and to be transmitted in affected families by men-delian mechanisms.

abscopal effects of whole-bodyx-irradiation on compensatory hypertrophyof the rat kidney.the weight and dna content of normal growing (i.e., intact), andhypertrophying (i.e., following uninephrectomy) rat kidneys wereobtained from several hundred sprague-dawley white rats.  theeffect of whole body x irradiation with 500 rad and local irradiationto the kidney with 1000 rad, was then determined by following therate and degree of hypertrophy and the dna content of the kidney.when calculated on the basis of body surface area, a constant ratioof kidney weight and of kidney dna was found in the normal, non-hypertrophying kidneys of 5-12 week old rats.  after 21 days ofhypertrophy these values increased approximately 50 per cent overnormal in rats 4-6 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy.  foranimals 6-14 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy the correspondingincrease was only about 20 per cent.following uninephrectomy and x irradiation with 1000 rad to theexteriorized remaining kidney, 4 week old rats whose bodies werelead-shielded during irradiation showed no body weight growthretardation, no significant difference in the dna content of thekidney, and a small but significant decrease in weight incrementof the hypertrophying kidney after 21 days.rats exposed to 500 rad of x rays with the kidney shielded duringirradiation, when compared with nonirradiated controls, showed bodyweight growth retardation, a reduction in the dna content of thekidney, and a reduction in the amount of kidney hypertrophy 21 daysfollowing uninephrectomy.  a still greater inhibition of both kidneycompensatory hypertrophy and the increase in dna content of thekidney occurred after 500 rad whole body irradiation.food restriction in nonirradiated 4 week old rats resulting inbody weight growth retardation, elicited a marked reduction inkidney weight and in dna content of the hypertrophying kidney 21days after uninephrectomy.it is concluded that the reduction in kidney hypertrophy followingwhole body x irradiation with 500 rad is due in some measure to anabscopal or indirect effect, secondary to decreased body weight.

(3) specific type, presentingthe picture of cholangiolitis.histological changes in the liver other than biliarystasis were scanty.  no specificchanges which could clinically differentiate the3 types were found.  in each type,serum bilirubin, sgot and sgpt activities hadslight characteristic points in clinicaland laboratory studies.  in type 1, the valueswere relatively low, while in type2 they were markedly high.  in type 3, sgot activitywas within normal range.  histologicalcharacteristics of the liver of type 1were necrosis of liver cells, formationof acidophilic granules and balloon cells,cellular infiltration in glisson's capsule,and biliary stasis in the liver cells andfine bile ducts.  morphologically, findingsof viral hepatitis were observed.  in type2 liver tissue was replaced by manymultinuclear giant cells.  extreme distortionof cords of liver cells and cellular infiltrationin glisson's capsule and lobules werenoted.  there was marked biliarystasis in the capillary bile ducts and liver cells.it was characteristic that proliferationof bile ducts and bile plugs were not found,which was consistent with giantcell hepatitis of craing-landing.  in type 3, degenerationof liver cells, necrosisand inflammatory changes were slight.  biliarystasis in the hepatic lobules was conspicuous.histological findings similar to cholangiolitichepatitis due to drug poisoningwere observed.

psychological effects of circumcision .in order to evaluate the psychological effects of circumcision, asmall study was arranged in which twelve children, from average and lowsocio-economic level, were given goodenough dam test, cat, rorschach andtwo sets of stories, prior to the operation and following it . theresults of the tests showed that circumcision, performed around thephallic stage is perceived by the child as an act of aggression andcastration . it has detrimental effects on the child's functioning andadaptation, particularly on his ego strength . by weakening thecontrolling and defensive mechanisms of the ego, and initiatingregression, it loosens the previously hidden fears, anxieties, andinstinctual impulses, and renders a feeling of reality to them . what isexpressed following the operation is primitive, archaic, andunsocialized in character . as a defensive control and protectionagainst the surge of the instinctual forces coming from within and thethreats coming from outside, the ego of the child seeks safety in totalwithdrawal, thus isolates and insulates itself from disturbing stimuli .the results of the study raised some questions concerning certainpsychoanalytic formulations, for which further research was suggested .possibilities for future research were also discussed .

1991. ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation.medical and pathologic aspectsthirty-four patients with ventricular septal defectand aortic regurgitation, repre-senting less than 5% of the patients with ventricularseptal defect, are discussed.a loud, systolic murmur, characteristic of ventricularseptal defect, is noted dur-ing infancy, whereas evidences of aortic regurgitation(protodiastolic murmur andwide pulse pressure) does not usually appear until sometime between 2 and 10years of age.  clinical and catheterization data indicatethat the principal hemody-namic load is aortic regurgitation, whereas theventricular septal defect does notusually result in a large pulmonary blood flow orhigh pulmonary arterial pressure.in about 50% of the patients, a significant pressuregradient across the right ven-tricular outflow tract exists.  detailed pathologicstudies indicate that the ventricularseptal defects are high and anterior and encroachto a greater or lesser degree onthe membranous bulbar septum.  the right coronarycusp is the one most severelyinvolved, and, by its prolapse, causes aorticregurgitation; the noncoronary cuspis always less severely affected.  the anatomic basisof the pressure gradient ob-served across the right ventricular outflow tract isnot always clear.

effects of short term administration ofhysiological doses of human growth hormonein three patients with turner's syndromeh. e. sjobergthe effect of apparently physiological doses of human growth hormonewas investigated in three patients with turner's syndrome in short termmetabolic balance studies.  the subjects presented an abnormal sex chro-mosome constitution and an increased level of sulphation factor activityin serum.two dose levels of hormone were used, and there appeared an anabolicresponse to both.  no correlation with dose was obtained for any of theparameters used except for urinary magnesium, where the retention wasgreater with the higher dose.  the sulphation factor activity of serum in-creased during hormone administration in the one case studied in thisrespect.the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was within the normal range inthe two patients studied in this respect, and was not altered by growthhormone.all patients had an increased urinary excretion of creatine which atpresent cannot be explained.  the creatinuria diminished during growthhormone treatment.the mechanism behind the retarded growth is discussed.  it is suggestedthat a major factor might be a defect in the center for linear growth,i.e. the epiphyses that would make these less responsive to all the factorsnormally stimulating the growth processes in the epiphyseal zones.

implications of gerstmann's syndrome .of 465 consecutive patients subjected to a standardized battery ofneuropsychological tests, 111 had one or more components of gerstmann'ssyndrome . each of these 111 patients had some evidence of organic braindysfunction in addition to gerstmann components . as the number ofgerstmann components increased, the responsible brain lesions tended tobe larger, more highly destructive of tissue, and to cause greaterneurological impairment . every patient with four gerstmann componentshad associated evidence of severe impairment of brain functions and thelesion or underlying disease was likely to compromise survival of thepatient . the syndrome is not to be regarded as an autonomous entity,but merges with numerous other neurological deficits, notably dysphasiain agreement with benton, we find no justification for singling outthe four gerstmann components as a separate syndrome, unless one is alsoprepared to recognize that any other arbitrary groups of concurrentdeficits are also separate syndromes .in at least three of 23 patients with all four gerstmann components,the angular gyrus, as shown by necropsy examination, was not involved bythe lesion . however, the probability that the left hemisphere containeda lesion increased with the number of gerstmann components, and theprobability of involvement of the left posterior parasylvian area alsoincreased with the increase in the number of gerstmann components . withtwo, three, or four gerstmann components, the lesions were neverrestricted to the angular gyrus but tended to spread widely over theparietal, temporal, and occipital lobes . as to localizing significance,gerstmann's syndrome has approximately the same degree of cogency asdysphasia .

1848. the child's concept of deathin this translation of a paper, which firstappeared in 1912, it is shown, accordingto freud, how far a child's appreciationof being dead differs from its true signifi-cance.  death means a reversible decreasein life functions, that can be interruptedat any time, like sleep.  at other times itmay mean a temporary separation; butalways it is in man's power to change it.in this concept, the child's unconsciousfinds license for his sadism.  cruelty toanimals and death wishes against personsclose to him appear, in overcompensation, asexaggerated pity for dead creaturesand the belief in man's power over life and death.

the action of vasopressin in renal diabetes insipidus.as the water-retaining action of antidiuretichormone is eliminated in renal diabetesinsipidus, the steps in na transport canbe separately determined.  vasopressininduced a prompt increase in freewaterclearance and urinary volume, as wellas a delayed increase in sodium clearance.it is suggested that vasopressin bringsabout stimulation of sodium reabsorption inthe ascending limb of henle's loop.  itis supposed that both physiological actionsof antidiuretic hormone - the antidiureticand the sodium-active effect - become operativein two different places in the nephronand synergistically produce a maximumconcentration of urine.

linfangiografia no estudo da filariase linfaticain the first part of the present paper a study is presentedof the lymphangiogram of the normal african; the author hasnoticed that it is coincident with the one of the white indi-vidual.the second part includes the lymphangiographic examina-tion and the observation of lymph circulation (via risa)during the several stages of lymphatic filariasis.even during the asymptomatic stage, lymphangiographyshows ganglial hypertrophy with a slight fibrosis and occa-sional discreet alterations of the lymphatic trunks.in the symptomatic stage, the lymphangiographic aspectsvary according to the disease's different stages and there isnot always a relationship between the duration period of thesymptoms and the changes observed.in lymphangites, there are frequent alterations of thelymphatic trunks, i.e., increase in caliber, extensive and seg-mentary dilatations, numerical decrease with visualization ofanastomoses and higher permeability.  circulatory trouble evi-dences itself not only by a decrease in the rate of the lymphflow, but also by a very marked ganglial retention.in adenites, in spite of the marked ganglial hypertrophydue to intense sclerosis, there may be no considerable altera-tions in the lymphatics, but risa already shows clear circula-tion troubles leading to lymphatic stasis.in adenolymphoceles, the obstruction at the primitive-iliaclevel causes the lymph flow to deviate through the pre-sacralanastomoses and reflux to the inguinal glands, thus causingtheir dilatation and the formation of varicosities in the affe-rent lymphatics.in lymphedemas, our lymphangiographic results togetherwith risa's allow us to assume that the pathogeny is chieflyinfluenced by three factors: lymphatic obstruction due to lym-phangitis, insufficiency of the collateral ducts, and ganglialsclerosis.

speech and reading problems in childhood.the following communicative disordershave been discussed: functional articulationdefects, delayed speech development,stuttering, hearing loss, cleft palate,neurological disorders, and reading disorders.these disorders rarely have asingle cause.  they are the result of anintermingling of many factors, some physiologicaland some psychological, someresiding within the child and some in theparents and environment in general.  delayedor defective speech is a cause forgreat concern to most parents and teachers.the public health worker who listenswith an attentive and sympathetic ear mayallay some of this anxiety and thus helpfoster healthy emotional development inthe child.  the existence of a more seriouscondition underlying the presenting communicationproblem, even if sensed by theparents, is frequently denied.  the publichealth worker can assist the parents inthe painful process of facing up to theirfears.  a child with a communication problemis still a child and the public health workerby simply reflecting this to the parentsand advising them on normal child-raisingpractices can, again, be of help to thechild.  children with speech deviations areexposed to an overabundance of well-intentionedspeech correction at home.most of it is ineffective; some of it, unfortunatelyis harmful.  while the workermay not be in a position to offer specificadvice on a particular child, the mannerin which the parents and teacher are handlingthe child's communication problemcan be explored and damaging practicespossibly eliminated.  the fact that theremay be a diagnostic and treatment centerto which the child can be referred doesnot vitiate the public health worker's role.the public health physician and public healthnurse have a valuable contributionto make in helping the parents, school,and child accept the chronic nature of the disorder.

parathyroid extract-induced changes in the oxidation of citrate,succinate and other organic acids by liver.parathyroid extract (pte) or partiallypurified parathyroid hormone administered invivo markedly altered the oxidationin vitro by rabbit liver minces of citrate, -ketoglutarate-c, succinate-c, fumarate-cand lactate.  with ca ++ present in theincubation medium, minces from ptetreated animals produced more co and hada greater o consumption than did controlminces.  this stimulation was due, in partat least, to a more rapid decline in metabolicactivity of the control tissues.  whenca++ was absent, total metabolism wasincreased and the tissue derived from ptetreated animals was less active than thecontrol tissue.  the effect was detected asearly as 4 hr after injection (750 u/kg)and could be elicited with as little as 200 u(at 14 hr).  the action of pte could notbe duplicated by the injection of cacl intothe animal.  the data suggest that one effectof treatment was a general inhibition ofoxidation.  the stimulation of metabolismcould be a consequence of this inhibitionor a separate unrelated alteration.

617. maturation of postnatal human lung and the idiopathic respiratory distresssyndromematuration and pathologic alterations of the lungin 19 newborn infants who died of idiopathic respiratorydistress syndrome were studied by light-and electronmicroscopy.  normal lungs from 6 fetuses and 11 new-borns served as controls.  in all infants with idiopathicrespiratory distress syndrome, respiratory bronchio-les and alveolar ducts usually presented the histologicpattern of mature lungs, i.e. they were predominantlylined by type i cells, which also formed the epithelialcomponent of most blood-air barriers.  well expandedalveoli exhibited a similar pattern, whereas collapsedalveoli were lined by numerous type ii cells which par-ticipated in the formation of poorly developed blood-airbarriers.  the capacity of type ii cells to produce in-clusion bodies seemed to increase with survival beyondthe 14th hr of age.  secretion of inclusion bodies andpresumably surfactant into alveolar spaces did occurbut only in the lungs of infants older than 2 days.  how-ever, this process was not accompanied by reductionin the number of type ii cells per alveolus as in the nor-mal lung.  the distribution of pathologic changes in idio-pathic respiratory distress syndrome appeared to bedetermined by the degree of maturity of the air sacs.structurally mature air sacs were associated with da-mage of epithelial lining and hyaline membrane forma-tion.  in contrast, collapsed alveoli revealed an intactepithelial lining and marked septal edema but were freeof hyaline membranes.  the findings of this study sug-gested that transudation of plasma through well develop-ed blood-air barriers was responsible for epithelialdamage and hyaline-membrane formation in air sacs.they also suggested that alveolar collapse and presuma-bly lack of surfactant were related to abnormal matura-tion of the epithelial lining and to septal edema.

pleuropneumonia-like organismsdespite their small size, the pplo carrythe full complement of the chemical com-pounds and enzymes contained in largerbacteria and in cells.  they contain bothdna and rna, and in their independentmetabolism they are essentially like other freeliving cells in contrast to the viruses whichhave no independent metabolism outside theliving host cell.  several strains of pplo havebeen cultivated from the mucous membranesof apparently normal human subjects, espe-cially from the respiratory and urinary tracts.until recently, however, definite evidence ofthe association between the pplo and clear-ly defined clinical disease in the human sub-ject was lacking.  in 1962 it became evidentthat the so-called eaton "virus," originallyisolated by eaton and his associates in 1944from patients with primary atypical pneu-monia, was in reality a pleuropneumonia-likeorganism.  typical pplo colonies are pro-duced on a cell-free agar medium which isenriched by the addition of blood serum oryeast.  a number of strains of pplo has nowbeen identified, and in recognition of theirunique characteristics, they have been classi-fied in a separate order, the mycoplasmatales,genus mycoplasma.

major surgery in classic hemophilia using fraction i.  experience intwelve operations and review of the literature.a therapeutic regimen that provides hemostasis inhemophiliacs during and after major surgery without requiringlaboratory control has been established with afactor viii concentrate.  the effectiveness of this regimenof fraction i therapy was evaluated in major surgeryof 6 severely deficient and 4 moderately deficient hemophiliacs.an analysis of clinical results was made, combiningthe 12 operations of the series with the 116 majoroperative procedures on hemophiliacs recorded in theenglish literature, in which fraction i was the sole ormajor source of factor viii therapy.  dental and nondentalsurgery were analyzed separately, as was thespecial problem of blood cysts.  although the over-allmortality rate following major surgery in hemophiliacsis presently only 5 to 10% using factor viii concentrates,problems still remain.  these include the continued highincidence of abnormal postoperative hemorrhage, thevariation in factor viii potency of different lots of fractioni, the late development of serum hepatitis, hemolyticanemia due to contaminating isoantibodies and thehigh cost of adequate amounts of the product.  more efficientmethods of preparing purer and more potent factorviii concentrates could eliminate most of these difficulties.

major surgery on the severe hemophiliac, lessons in management.three cases of pseudotumor of the thigh whichrequired surgical amputation and onecase of open pericardial drainage for cardiactamponade are briefly reported in severehemophiliacs.  in the first case hemostasis, followingamputation, was produced, but thepatient died of septicemia secondary to proximallyinfected tissues; the level of amputationshould, therefore, be proximal to all grosslyinfected tissues.  in the second case, withinfected massive pseudotumor of the left thigh,5 separate operative procedures wereperformed.  the last procedure was elective revisionof skin flaps at the hip disarticulationsite.  here application of the knowledge gainedfrom previous experience resulted in a completelyuncomplicated postoperative course bydint of timing of the surgical procedurein relation to control of infection, loss of plasmafastness, and the judicious use of antibioticand direct-current electrocoagulation therapy.a plea is made to avoid the useof plasma and ahg therapy in hemophiliasfor trivial reasons and to consider patientsfor surgical procedures early in the course of theircomplications, which demand surgery,at a time when the patient is still responsiveto hematologic therapy and prior to theonset of infection in areas of hematoma.  it isfelt that a second significant hemorrhagein any particular site constitutes a bona fideindication for surgical intervention, longbefore the time when surgery is considered asthe last resort by the physician, patient andfamily.  although the authors believe that surgeryin the hemophiliac is not to be takenlightly, they do not endorse the prevailing nihilisticattitude that has resulted in temporizingdelays which can only guarantee a fatal outcome.

4105. free fatty acid metabolism in chinese hamstersin normal chinese hamsters (cricetulusgriseus) the mean concentration of freefatty acids (ffa) in serum varied fromgroup to group, but was (1) consistently 4to 9 times greater than in rats, dogs,or man; (2) slightly higher than in syrianhamsters; (3) two- to four-fold higherthan in fasting or alloxan-diabetic rats.  theepididymal adipose tissue of the chinesehamster (1) had initial concentrations offfa comparable to those in the rat andsyrian hamster; (2) released, in the sametime interval, 8- to 10-fold more ffain vitro than this tissue of the rat; (3) hadhigher concentrations of ffa after incubationthan the incubated tissue of the rat.the retroperitoneal (perirenal) adipose tissueof the chinese hamster was less ac-tive in release of fatty acids in vitro than theepididymal, but was, however, moreactive than the epididymal adipose tissue ofthe rat.  these characteristics of ffametabolism in the chinese hamster wereapparently attributable to species, not toage, diet, or sex.  in the chinese hamster,the weight of the epididymal adipose tis-sue per gram of body was relatively high.it appears that in this species the rate ofrelease of fatty acids from adipose tissueis great, leading to high ffa concentra-tions in serum.  in chinese hamster and ratadipose tissues in vitro, glucose and in-sulin (separately) reduced the rate of releaseof ffa and the amount of ffa in thetissues, but glucose and insulin togetherproduced the greatest reduction.  the netreduction in ffa release by glucose andinsulin in vitro was greater in tissue fromthe chinese hamster.  insulin markedlyincreased glucose uptake by the adipose tis-sues of both species.  the possible relationof the results to spontaneous diabetes inthe chinese hamster is discussed.

immunological studies on filariasis.  iii.  fractionation andpurification of antigen for intradermal skin reaction in filariasis.it had been reported that the antigen tcaobtained from adult worms of dirofilariaimmitis produced noticeable reactions infilariasis patients in whose blood microfilariaecould be demonstrated.  further fractionationand purification of this antigenwas attempted in order to study thesubstance responsible for the skinreaction and to obtain a more reliableantigen with high sensitivity and specificity.the fraction fs obtained by treatmentsimilar to that described inthe previous report was used as parent material.by gel-filtration and sephadexg-100 column chromatography of antigen fs,antigen fsi, which produced noticeablereactions in the filariasis patients,was obtained.  this highly reactive antigenfsi was separated into 6 fractions, viz.fsc-1,fsc-2, fsc-3, fsc-4, fsc-5 andfsc-6, by cm cellulose chromatography.the 6 antigens were tested at the 1(protein component) level on patients infectedwith wuchereria bancrofti.  antigenfsc-4, containing 1,500 of protein and40 of carbohydrate per ml., wasmost active.  next, the further fractionationof antigen fsc-4 by deae-sephadexa50 column chromatography was carriedout to yield 4 antigens, viz.fscd-1,fscd-2, fscd-3 and fscd-4.  the 4 antigenswere tested at the 0.05 (proteincomponent) level on filariasis patients. antigenfscd-1 produced the most noticeableskin reaction in the patients.  the eliminationof protein components from antigenfscd-1 was attempted with nagase (a proteolytic enzyme)and pronase to obtainantigens fscdn and fscdp.  each ofthese 2 antigens was tested on the patientsproved to have filariasis, but the reactionproduced by the injection of each antigenwas weaker than that produced by antigenfscd-1.  it may be inferred from thesestudies that the substance responsible forthe skin reaction is proteinic.

1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renalhomotransplantationdammin g. j.a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs hasbeen completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants.over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed.increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questionsregarding the status treated host.  the current drug protocol of azathioprineand diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50%100-day survivors.  the following observations have been documented  allanimals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapycan be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneysapparently are protected in some way in the new environment because asecond donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantationof a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decreasein renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted backto their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party,non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for theprolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a doubledose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption ormetabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results becausetwo kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in thesame drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient andthis sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned fromdrugs.  additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidneyhomografts reveal the following  skin homografts are universally rejectedwithin 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidneyhomografts sometimes permanently.  when skin and kidney homografts from thesame donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidneysurvival is shortened.  this paradoxical effect probably is explained by theproduction of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney.additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female,are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalizedimmunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.

1209. the theory and practice of the family diagnostic.  ii. theoreticalaspects and resident educationfamily intervention and observation have proveduseful in 3 areas.  the 1st of these is observation of thepsychosocial context in the patient.  on admission to amental hospital the phenomenon of extrusion and separ-ation from the family is evident, and the need for studyof the interaction between the patient and his familymilieu is vital.  the 2nd area where the family inter-view has a major role is resident education.  the tra-ditional medical education of the ill prepares the stu-dent for consideration of the multifactorial problems ofemotional disorder in which balances between mem-bers of a group may be the issue rather than externalpathogenes.  the family interview offers a unique pointof observation of factually evident and emotionally con-vincing group data.  in addition to the observation offamily phenomena, mutual understanding of others'problems is created.  finally, the family interviewserves as an instrument for data collection and hypo-thesis seeking in relating individual psychopathologyto family adaptations.  the patient and his family atthe time of admission are dealing with a crisis.  some-times this is traumatic, such as the unexpected lossof a young marital partner, an unexpected illness, ora financial reverse.  more commonly, however, it isdevelopmental being a natural part of the life cycle.characteristically, the developmental task involvedin dealing with the crises has been postponed so thatone does not see the family at the age specific and ap-propriate time for this task.  the crisis emerges dis-ruptively because of inevitable biological maturation,personal decision, or social expectation.  a primaryconcern of the leader is to determine what life task isbeing faced.  families have a mentally ill member notmerely because they are dealing with the vicissitudesof life.  they are unable to cope with the crisis, be-cause of the feelings which are aroused.  each life cri-sis leads to a particular constellation of effects in anygiven family.  these include primarily, sadness, anger,and guilt, but there may well be specific affective con-stellations appropriate to different developmental tasks.the patient's inability to cope with a life crisis is dueto his particular adaptation of a style of dealing withfeelings that is employed by other members of the family.

disturbances of the verbal body image.. a particular syndrome of sensoryaphasia .1. the pto syndrome of the dominant hemisphere varies according to theextent and depth of the lesion in the angular and supramarginal areas .the mildest clinical syndrome consists of a vague contralateral sensoryimpairment associated with dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia anddifficulty in naming . a more extensive lesion is needed to cause thewide variety of classical signs described in parietal lobe disease,among them being gerstmann's syndrome, which is usually found inassociation with other manifestations of parietal loss (case 1) . aneven more extensive corticosubcortical lesion in the area leads tocomplete disintegration of naming and understanding of speech (cases 3,4 and 5) .2. attention is drawn to the difficulties arising from lack ofdifferentiation between the concrete gnostic body image and the abstractverbal body image in investigation of these patients . the aphasicsyndrome should be differentiated from disturbances of gnosis byapplication of separate, non-verbal methods of testing to elicit theimpairment of the gnostic body image . the latter may be wellcompensated for and it is apparently unimpaired in the presence of anaphasic syndrome limited to the verbal body image .3. disturbances of speech in pto lesions if investigated alongquantitative scales of impairment of repetition, understanding andnaming, show a regular interrelation . nomination is the most affected,understanding is less affected . repetition is the best preservedfunction (cases 1-4) . the same interrelation of these functions isfound with regard to the verbal body image . however, understanding andnaming of parts of the body show far greater disintegration thanunderstanding and naming of any other categories of words (all casespresented here) . if the aphasic syndrome is subsiding, finger aphasiawith some other minor disturbances of verbal body image associated withacalculia may persist (case 1) . thus gerstmann's /finger agnosia/ mayrepresent a partial impairment of the verbal body image and be limitedto finger aphasia .4. it is assumed that the verbal body image differs from othercategories of verbal symbols owing to the mainly proprioceptive,vestibular and tactile experience forming its specific physiologicbackground . telereceptive experience is of minor importance in theinitial development of the understanding of words defining the bodyimage .in the patients described here, the selectively worse aphasicimpairment of the verbal body image, as compared with other categoriesof words, seem to confirm this assumption .

functional craniology: an aid ininterpreting roentgenogramsof the skullanalysis of the form of the skull isfacilitated by considering it to be composedof a number of functional components.  forthe roentgenologist's purposes, division intothe facial or somatic skeleton and the neu-ral skeleton is valuable, as is the recognitionof three functionally separate portionswithin each calvarial bone: the inner table,the diploe and the outer table.the base of the skull is the only por-tion that is preformed in cartilage.  this ac-counts for the unusual appearance of theskull in achondroplasia.  in addition, thebase apparently is more closely related tofacial and general somatic growth than toneural growth.calvarial bone forms directly frommembrane within the cerebral capsule.consequently, the size and shape of the cal-varia directly reflect the form of the grow-ing neural mass.the inner table of the calvaria at allages is intimately related to the dura materand directly reflects the form of the duramater.  consequently, the inner table re-flects the form of the arachnoid mater and,usually, of the brain as well.the outer table of the calvaria servesnot only to protect the brain but also toanchor many of the intrinsic and extrinsicmuscles of the skull.  its form, particularlyin thick-skulled mammals such as the pig,is determined more by the demands of thesemuscles and of the scalp than by the formof the brain.the principal function of the diploeis to form a lightweight yet rigid separationof the two osseous tables.  in addition, itserves as a site of hematopoiesis; for thisreason it may tend to a specific volume at agiven age.the calvarial sutures oppose separa-tion of the bones of the calvaria while al-lowing relative motion between them.when the calvarial bones are passively car-ried apart with the expanding cerebral cap-sule by the growth of the neural mass, theirareas are increased by the deposition ofbone in the suture margins.  the sutures,however, do not function as epiphyses andhave no innate growth potential: removalof a suture does not disturb final skull form.because the calvaria represents ossi-fication of the cerebral capsule, it is smallwhen the neural mass is small.  the de-formity of the skull and the secondarychanges that occur in the air sinuses andthe diploe can be explained in terms ofthe functional cranial components.  the op-posite changes occur when the neural massis abnormally large.the correlation between skull size andintelligence is only fair.  the presence of abrain of distinctly abnormal size, however,may be inferred from plain roentgeno-grams of the skull.premature closure of the cranial su-tures may be due to an abnormal form ofthe cranial base and possibly of the primi-tive chondrocranium that precedes it.  theabnormality is mediated through the duralfiber tracts that underlie the major cal-varial sutures.

2542. symposium on the fine structure and replication of bacteria and theirparts. ii. bacterial cytoplasmcomparison of the fine structure of thecytoplasm of the bacterial cell with that ofthe 'cell in general' reveals importantdifferences leading to the conclusion that, inthe bacterial cytoplasm, there is littledifferentiation into separate functional en-tities.  there is no nuclear membrane, andfine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo-plasm into the cytoplasm where they mayexpand in all directions.  the cytoplasm is notnecessarily intersected by membranousprofiles of special configuration, as is borneout by e. coli b and other gram-negativeorganisms.  when membranous profilesof special configuration are present, asin the gram-positive b. subtilis, thesedo not appear differentiated into clearlydefinable endoplasmic reticulum, golgisubstance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria.as for kinetosomes, the presenceof centrioles is perhaps not very likely.  theexperiments in which tellurite is re-duced in the cells suggest that there arestructures at the base of the flagella withreductive capacity.  however, upon applicationof the tetranitro-blue tetrazoliumtechnic to b. subtilis, these are not stained.they are presumably identical withbasal granules.  the membranous structuresin b. subtilis are called chondrioidsby the author because probably one of theirfunctions is that they are the sites ofthe respiratory enzyme chain.  in thegram-negative p. vulgaris, the probable siteof the respiratory chain has a structurevery different from that in the bacillus; itis not clear whether membranes areinvolved in their structure.  morphologically,even in b. subtilis chondrioids differfundamentally from the mitochondria in thatthey are not built up from compositemembranes, they are extensions of the plasmamembrane, and they may not be completelyclosed systems.  regarding this lastpoint, it was observed that chondrioids maypossibly stand in open connection withthe cell's environment, since its lumen is notseparated from the cell wall by aplasma membrane.  although as yet nothing isknown about this, it does not seem tobe precluded that these membranous organellesmay function also as intracellulartransport systems.  contrary to porter's ideasabout er, the chondrioids are notextensions of a nuclear envelope, but of theplasma membrane.  on the other hand,they are in the nuclear area, in direct contactwith the nucleoplasm, and therefore,perhaps, they need not carry in their interiorsome dna, as is now becoming knownfor ordinary mitochondria.  the chromatophorevesicle is of a simple structure andin connection with the plasma membrane.  it iscovered by a single membrane andthus resembles the granum disc, but it is muchsmaller.  in tissue cells, an im-portant function of the er is the support of proteinsynthesis by ribosomes boundto their surfaces.  evidence is now accumulatingthat the active complexes for poly-peptide synthesis in bacteria are also membrane-boundand are series of 70s ribo-somes using the same messenger rna molecule.it remains a contradictory situ-ation that the particles obtained here through releaseof cytoplasm from protoplastsin diluted, rather crude fixing media, and identifiedas ribosomes, could not berecognized as such in thin sections of the ryter-kellenbergerfixed protoplasts.this point is much in need of clarification.  buteven if the cytoplasm in the thinsections of the protoplasts is in a state ofdispersion brought about artificially, itis still apparent from the various micrographsthat basically the cytoplasm is anetwork of presumably linear arrays, with manyinterconnections due to fibrillarsystems.  fibrils from the nucleoplasm penetratedeeply into the cytoplasm.  thepresence of fine fibrils of various thicknesses,electron densities, and orientationsmakes high-resolution study of the cytoplasmicdetails an intriguing prospect fromwhich much fundamental information can begained.  the organizational pattern onthe ultrastructural level in bacteria revealsfundamental similarities and divergen-cies from that in the 'cell in general'.
