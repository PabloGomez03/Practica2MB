the determinants of cerebrospinal fluid po2 the effects of oxygen andcarbon dioxide breathing in patients with chronic lung disease .the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 of some hypoxemic hypercapnicpatients with chronic lung disease is the same as that of patientswithout chronic lung disease . breathing 95 oxygen with 5 carbon dioxideincreased lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 more than breathing 95 oxygenwith 5 nitrogen . the change in cerebrospinal fluid po2 is closelyrelated to the change in arterial pco2, and this relationship is similarto the relationship between arterial pco2 and cerebral blood flow inpatients with and without hypercapnia . interpretation of theseobservations must be qualified by the following.. cisternalcerebrospinal fluid po2 differs from lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 inits response to breathing oxygen with carbon dioxide,. regulation ofblood flow to the spinal cord and nerve roots is not known to becomparable to that of the brain,. and factors other than blood flow mayhave contributed to the changes of cerebrospinal fluid po2 .

1320. the plasma free fatty acid composition and blood glucoseof normal and diabetic pregnant women and of their new-bornsthe blood glucose and plasma ffa contentand composition of the newborns ofnormal women, gestational diabetics, andinsulin-dependent diabetics were analyzed.normal maternal ffa levels were twice thefetal values; by 2 hr of age ffa in-creased 4-fold over initial values in normalinfants, while infants of gestationaldiabetics had a 3-fold rise, and those ofinsulin dependent diabetics only 2-fold.blood sugar at the same time decreased andthere was an inverse relationship be-tween blood glucose in the normal infants andffa.  this relationship is altered inthe infant of the diabetic mother.  gaschromatography of plasma indicated a higherratio of unsaturated to saturated ffa inmothers compared to infants.  no patterndifferences were noted between the normaland diabetic mothers, except that thelatter had higher oleic acid.  in the initial 2hr of life, the patterns changed, althoughno differences were noted between infantsof diabetic mothers and normals.  theobservations suggest  (1) the metabolicinterrelationships of glucose and ffa inthe normal infant are different from thosein the infant of the diabetic mother, thelatter infant having a state of physiologichyperinsulinism; (2) plasma ffa in thefetus is derived from both fetal fat synthesisas well as placental transfers; (3) theinfant of the diabetic mother does not differfrom the normal as regards ffa com-position.

renal factors in the pathogenesis of hypertensionrenal arteriography and other modern diagnostic procedures have providedthe means of establishing a close relationship between high blood pressure andrenovascular disease.  many of these cases are amenable to surgical cure.  atthe present time there is no single test for the definitive diagnosis of renalhypertension.  careful and intensive studies are mandatory in the selection ofcases suitable for surgery, since hypertension has many etiologic factors andinvolves many complex and sometimes obscure mechanisms.  aortography,intravenous urography and split-function tests are among the most importantmethods for definitive diagnosis and for the planning of appropriate surgicalprocedures.at operation, the most commonly observed cause of renal arterial con-striction in the elderly is atherosclerosis, whereas in younger patients it ishyperplasia of the intimal and muscular coats of the renal artery and itsbranches.  renovascular surgery may require a variety of technical procedures.in the successful cases there is a striking and permanent reduction in bloodpressure.the accuracy of blood pressure readings is emphasized, since hypertensionis usually discovered for the first time during the course of a routinephysical examination.

serological relationships among human mycoplasmas as shownby complement-fixation and gel diffusionand robert m. chanockantigenic relationships among humanmycoplasmas were studied by complement-fixation and agar gel diffusion techniques.  fourrecognized human species.  mycoplasma hoministype 1, m. hominis type 2, m. salivarium, andm. fermentans were antigenically distinct inthese tests.  in addition, m. pneumoniae (eatonagent, the etiological agent of cold agglutinin-positive atypical pneumonia) was different fromthese four species.  although these species weredistinct, evidence of shared antigenic componentswas obtained in complement-fixation and agargel diffusion tests.  since rabbits were immunizedwith mycoplasmas grown in rabbit muscle infu-sion broth supplemented with rabbit serum or,in the case of m. pneumoniae, with infected chickembryo lung suspension, the possibility that theheterologous reactions resulted from antibodyto growth medium components could be excluded.four recent mycoplasma isolates from the oro-pharynx were analyzed, and three were shown tobe closely related to m. hominis type 1, and thefourth was closely related to m. salivarium.although the recent isolates could not be dis-tinguished from the related "prototype" humanspecies by complement-fixation, differences couldbe detected by the agar gel diffusion technique.

evaluation and treatment planningfor autistic childreninfantile autism is considered to be a re-action on the part of an immature organismat a primitive and undifferentiated stage ofego development.  little choice of defensivereactions is available; the possibility of sub-limation does not exist and, even thoughother object relationships are graduallydeveloping, the mother is still the child'sprimary object.  at this vulnerable develop-mental stage, a wide range of pathologicalcircumstances, ranging from the most severefamily psychopathology to the most adventi-tious physiological traumata or the most un-fortunately malignant circumstances, mayconstitute an acute or cumulative cata-strophic stress.  the primitive organismtends to respond to this overwhelming stresswith a paranoid reaction which is directed atthe mother (regardless of the actual etiologi-cal variables) because the mother is still thechild's primary object.  we believe that thechild then responds with an autistic reactionand shows varying degrees of simple with-drawal, obsessional behavior, magical or de-lusional thought processes, and consequentdisruption of developmental skills, speech,and relationships with others.many families can and do make everyeffort to counter the paranoid reaction of thechild and do not respond to his rejection withcounterrejection and counterwithdrawal.some of the child's autistic symptoms mayabate without formal treatment.  yet, sincethe mother (and family) are the primaryobjects of the child's paranoid attitude, it isfelt that formal therapeutic intervention isnecessary to modify the paranoid core ofthe autistic reaction.

3083. myocardial toxicity of contrast agents used in angiographythe myocardial toxicity of many current andsome experimental contrast agentshas been studied in dogs, by use of a previouslyunreported method of occlusionretrograde coronary venography as well as thefamiliar technique of selectivecoronary arterial catheterization.  the followingconclusions appear justified inthe light of the experiments   not only theiodine-containing radicals with which thecontrast agents are so often identified (acetrizoates,diatrizoates, iothalamates,etc.), but also the final salification products appearto be responsible for the widelydivergent degrees of myocardial toxicity of contrastagents, to the point that differ-ent salts of the same compound behave as entirelydifferent agents both chemicallyand biologically.  the results seem to indicate thedominance of sodium ion and/orthe protective effect of methylglucamine salts withrespect to the myocardial toxi-city of current radiopaque media.  reported,yet unexplained, electrocardiographicchanges occurring within one to two secondsfrom the beginning of massive cavalhigh-pressure injections appear to find acausal relationship in the myocardial ir-ritability induced by the distention of thecoronary veins and the myocardial infiltra-tion which is intentionally enhanced withour retrograde injection techniques.  a pe-culiar trait, shared in varying degrees byall radiopaque agents tested, is theirability to increase coronary blood flow.the clinical significance of this phenome-non, however, remains to be established.these studies re-emphasize the limita-tions of the standard toxicity studies conductedin animals.  it should be clear fromthe results reported that agents to beadministered into the coronary circulationdemand investigation in regard to theirpotential toxicity by the methods describedherein or variations thereof.  in fact,similar tests should be carried out for all or-gans to be subjected to radiographicexamination via the vascular bed.  the authorshope that this presentation will stimulaterenewed investigation, particularly in viewof the growing clinical applications ofselective cardiovascular opacification tech-niques.

(1) emigration andmigration of lymphocytes from the explant,. (2) clustering oflymphocytes around /target/ cells,. (3) ameboid transformation oflymphocytes,. (4) lymphocytic congregation,. and (5) emperipolesis .criteria for these different lymphocytic activities have been amplifiedor introduced .findings of particular interest were.. (1) the frequency of both viable and nonviable lymphocytes within the vacuoles of other cells . thisobservation is considered to be an absolute criterion for the recogni-tion of emperipolesis . a subsequent /inclusionbody/ appearance of thedead lymphocytes has been observed . (2) the intimate relationship ofameboid forms of lymphocytes to selected cells, resulting in ajuxtanuclear and frequently unipolar crowding of one cell by numerouslymphocytes while nearby cells were totally devoid of ameboidlymphocytes . reasons are given to support the impression that thisphenomenon is re lated to sensitization . there is also the possibilitythat the phenomenon may indicate that the lymphocyte is /conditioned/ .(3) the apparent entry of the lymphocyte into the cell has been recordedby timelapse cinematography .a lymphocyte relationship to cancer cells was infrequently foundalthough explants of 15 of the 20 cases produced identifiable cancercells and lymphocytes emigrated from the explants of all 20 cases . itis not apparent from this limited study whether this is a significantfinding .

lactate and pyruvate in the brain of rats during hyperventilation .experiments on anesthetized and curarized rats under artificialventilation show that during hyperventilation lactate and pyruvate aremarkedly increased both in blood and in brain . the lactate/pyruvateratio which remains in blood the same as in control conditions, issystematically decreased in brain . during hypoxia (ventilation with 7oxygen in nitrogen) lactate rises markedly in blood and in brain . thelactate/pyruvate ratio which is strongly increased in blood shows asmall rise in brain . these observations could indicate that a differentmechanism is responsible for the rise of lactate in brain during hypoxiaand hyperventilation . the important augmentation of lactate in brainduring hyperventilation can give an explanation for the delayed risewhich is seen in the lactate level in cerebrospinal fluid in theseconditions .

rate of change of carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood, jugularvenous blood and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid on carbon dioxideadministration .1. the rate of change of p in arterial blood and cisternal c.s.f., wasmeasured following 5 percent co administration in eight anaesthetizedpatients undergoing routine air encephalography . ventilation wasmaintained constant throughout the procedure by a respirator . in threeof the experiments the rate of change of p in the jugular venous bloodwas also measured .2. the rise in p varied between 25.7 and 14.8 mm hg . the finalsamples of blood and c.s.f. were taken 20-25 min after the start of coadministration in five experiments . at this time the mean rise in p was65.9 (maximum range 68.1-61.6 percent) of the rise in p . in theremaining three experiments the final samples were taken at 15 min whenthe rises in p were 53.2, 39.4 and 38.1 percent of the arterial change .3. the increases in p were 57.5, 76.2 and 76.1 percent of those in thearterial blood . the changes in p in the c.s.f. were smaller than in thejugular venous blood in all three experiments . in two of theexperiments the final samples were taken 15 min after the start of coadministration when the increases of p in the c.s.f. were 68.5 percentand 50 percent of those in jugular venous blood . in one experimentwhere the final samples were taken at 20 min the increase in p was 89percent of the rise in p .4. there was a delay, following the start of co administration, in therise of p in jugular venous blood and in the c.s.f . this delay wasabout 1 min in the jugular venous blood but in the c.s.f. it varied from1.6 to 4.2 min (mean 2.3) .5. the rise of p in blood and c.s.f. was exponential . the rise in pin all experiments consisted of a fast component with time constantswhich varied between 0.2 and 0.9 min (mean 0.5) and a slow componentwith time constants varying between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .the rise in p and p consisted of only one component . the timeconstants for the changes in jugular venous blood were 2.1, 3.8 and 4.3min, whilst in the c.s.f. they varied between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .6. it is probable that about 40 percent of the increase in ventilationfollowing co administration is due to stimulation of an area in theantero-lateral surface of the medulla sensitive to changes in ph or p(mitchell et al. 1963) . this area is superficial and ventilation isaffected by changes in the p of the overlying c.s.f . it can bepredicted from our experiments that the rise in p on co administrationwill take some 30 min to be complete . this may explain the slow rise inventilation on co breathing when compared with the rate of rise ofarterial and jugular venous p .

3927. studies on growth and cytomorphosisin the thymo-lympha-tic systems - with specialreference to the influence ofthe thymus and the thyroidin guinea-pigsmigratory streams of lymphocytes betweendifferent parts of the thymo-lymphaticsystem were evaluated by comparisons betweenlymphocyte populations in thoracic-duct lymph and arterial and venous blood,especially thymic venous blood.  by re-cording organ weights in sham-operated andthymectomized guinea-pigs, treatedwith thyroxin or untreated, the importanceof the thymus and the thyroid for growthand regeneration in the thymo-lymphaticsystem was studied.  the main results areas follows.  there is a considerable venousoutput of lymphocytes with low mito-chondrial content (small lymphocytes) fromthe thymus in normal young guinea-pigs.this explains the much higher incidence ofsmall lymphocytes in blood than in tho-racic-duct lymph.  neonatal thymectomycauses lymphatic hypotrophy with defi-ciency of lymphocytes and pyroninophiliccells in relation to reticular ones.  bodygrowth and survival of the animals are notaffected.  in the thymus, exogenousthyroxin most probably promotes differentiationof large basophilic cells to smalllymphocytes, resulting in an increased output ofsmall lymphocytes.  in the lymphnodes, thyroxin promotes differentiation of largepyroninophilic cells ('transitionalcells') into immature and mature plasma cells.the effects of thyroxin on dif-ferentiation are followed by an increased growthof the thymo-lymphatic organs,characterized by an increased incidence of largebasophilic cells and increased weightof the lymphatic organs.  growth of the thymus andlymph nodes precedes that ofthe red splenic pulp.  this delayed splenic responseis not due to a transformationof an increased number of immigrated thymiclymphocytes, as neonatal thymectomydoes not prevent the thyroxin-stimulatedoccurrence of large basophilic cells in thered splenic pulp.  the thyroxin-stimulatedgrowth of the lymphatic system is ac-companied by an increased output of largerlymphocytes through the thoracicduct, resulting in an increased number oflarger lymphocytes in the blood.  inpostnatally thymectomized animals, having anormal (or above normal) amount ofcirculating small lymphocytes, thyroxin producesa drastic decrease in the number ofsmall blood lymphocytes, indicating a decreaseddelivery and/or increased disappear-ance of these cells to and from the blood, respectively.this decrease in number of smalllymphocytes is not seen in sham-operated animals.as judged by studies of organweights, the thyroxin-stimulated growth andregeneration of the lymphatic tissueare influenced antagonistically by thymectomyand synergistically by local factorsin involuted tissue.

the periodicity of microfilariae.x. the relation between the circadian temperature cycleof monkeys and the microfilarial cycle.monkeys were used whose blood contained the microfilariae of edesonfilariamalayensis, which has a nocturnal periodicity.artificial lowering of the body temperature during the daytime caused themicrofilaria count in the blood to rise; and artificial raising of the bodytemperature during the night caused it to fall almost to zero, i.e. inversionof the normal circadian temperature rhythm of the body was followed byinversion of the microfilarial rhythm.the hypothesis is put forward that the circadian rhythm of the microfilariaeof e. malayensis (but probably not of the microfilariae of some other species)is entrained by the circadian rhythm of body temperature, which thus providesthe "effective stimuli" to which these microfilariae respond.

1545. the effect of combined glucose and insulin infusions onthe lipoid and carbohydrate metabolism of the parturientwoman and of the fetusthe infusion of glucose with insulin during deliverywas used by the authors pri-marily in order to determine, whether the utilizationof glucose can be enhancedunder these conditions.  they wanted to investigate,whether the increase of unesteri-fied fatty acids in the cord blood which takes placeafter a sole glucose infusion inthe mother, could be caused by the low capabilityof glucose utilization in the fetus.the infusion during delivery which consisted of theapplication of 500 ml of 10%glucose and 16 u of insulin over a period of 30 min.brought about a greater decreaseof unesterified fatty acids in the parturient womanas compared with the infusion ofglucose exclusively.  the reason for this resultis thought to be due to a better utili-zation of glucose which is favorably influencedby insulin.  during the infusion ofglucose with insulin, an increase in the valuesof lactic and pyruvic acid took placein the parturient women; this was probably dueto an accelerated glycolysis and anincreased production of lactic acid, but notcaused by a higher share of the anaerobicmetabolism.  in the cord blood, there werelikewise increased values of lactic and py-ruvic acid as a reflection of the higher valuesof these substances in the mother.  theformation of these products of metabolicbreakdown by the fetus, however, was notsignificantly increased.  after infusion ofglucose with insulin, the other investigatedparameter values, including those of the levelsof unesterified fatty acids are foundin the cord blood in similar amounts as afterinfusion of glucose alone.  these re-sults cannot reliably prove the passage ofinsulin through the placenta especiallyafter a continued study of the metabolic valuesin newborns.  as a proof of the passageof insulin through the placenta could not beestablished, it is possible that after anintake of insulin the increase of unesterifiedfatty acids in the cord blood could becaused by a relative insufficiency of the insularapparatus of the fetus.  the mostprobable reason for the increase of unesterifiedfatty acids is the different depo-sition and metabolization of unesterified fattyacids in the course of intrauterinelife.

1808. separation anxiety  a factor in the object relations ofschizophrenic patients.the thesis is advanced thatspecial vulnerability to separation anxiety is a crucialfactor in the schizophrenic's difficulty in establishingand maintaining satisfactory interpersonal relationships.2 major reasons for this are lack of autonomy and lackof object constancy.  without a stable autonomouscapacity for self-regulation and adaptation, he is inordi-nately dependent upon others for help, protection, anddirection.  without object constancy, he is unable tomaintain a stable representation of the needed person inthe latter's absence.  evidence is presented from theintensive psychotherapy of schizophrenic patients.many of the vicissitudes of the doctor-patient relation-ship center about the patient's separation anxiety andhis attempted defenses against it.  these include clinging,perceptual and cognitive distortions designed to denyseparation, and recourse to substitute objects.  promi-nent in many of these efforts is the attempt to reversepassive victimization into active mastery.  the practicalimplications of this thesis for the treatment of schiz-ophrenic patients are discussed.

labial supportive appliancethe patient with a repaired cleft lip and palate and an associateddisplacement and deficiency of the premaxilla presents problems whichmay be of concern to the plastic surgeon, speech pathologist, orthodontist,and prosthodontist.the upper lip may appear flat or retruded in relation to the lower lip.when maxillary anterior teeth are missing, either congenitally, naturally(as in the mixed dentition period), or because of neglect, the upper lipmay appear to be rolled under the premaxilla.  the lower lip usuallyassumes a characteristic 'pouty' appearance.this complex of tissue deformities also may be important in the articulationof speech sounds.  fricatives and plosives are difficult to producecorrectly because of the malposition of the lip.  there may be interferencewith direction of air current, contact of tongue to alveolar ridge, andnormal contact of lips.corrective procedures are designed to improve the labial profile and toestablish more normal relationships of intraoral structures.  theseprocedures, employed individually or in combination, may include othodonticmovement of maxillary segments, dental prosthesis, and cheiloplasty.another more recently developed adjunct involves autogenousosscous implantation in the cleft areas.

the aetiology and treatment ofurinary calculusinvestigations in this laboratory have beenbased on the hypothesis that calculus formation isprimarily a process of crystallization from super-saturated solutions rather than one of adsorptionon a specific protein matrix, as has been postulatedby boyce and his colleagues (boyce and king,1963).  that crystallization is the primary factoris strongly suggested by the recent studies ofvermeulen, lyon and gill (1964).  these authorsproduced artificial concretions which closelyresembled urinary calculi by immersing a rotatingwire loop in normal urine for several days andslowly adding the appropriate stone-formingelements.if the above hypothesis is correct then thefactors of primary interest in urinary stoneformation are those responsible for supersaturation,nucleation and crystal poisoning.  much remainsto be learnt about these various factors, theirinter-relationships, and their relative importance.the significance of the urinary colloids (proteins,muco-proteins and polysaccharides) in calculusformation is still not clear but it is probable thatthey play an important secondary role in bindingcrystalline precipitates to form a non-friablecalculus.  since time is an important factor incrystal growth such non-specific binding byproteins would increase the chances of stonegrowth and retention within the upper urinarytract.

the relationship between vitamin d and parathyroidhormonemarit von stedingkthe effect of parathyroidectomy and parathy-roid hormone administration upon the concentra-tions of plasma calcium and phosphate have beenmeasured in vitamin d-deficient rats and the re-sults compared to those observed in d-fed ani-mals.  also, the influence of dietary calcium andphosphate content upon these responses has beeninvestigated.  parathyroidectomy in the d-fed ani-mal results in a rapid fall in plasma calcium and abiphasic plasma phosphate response with an initialfall followed by a striking rise.  in contrast,parathyroidectomy in the d-deficient rat is fol-lowed by no significant change in plasma calciumand an immediate rise in plasma phosphate thatcan be prevented by the administration of para-thyroid hormone.  dietary phosphate restrictionabolished the effect of parathyroidectomy in bothgroups of animals.administration of a dose of 500 u of hormoneto the intact d-deficient rat had little influenceupon plasma calcium; a dose of 2,000 u did in-crease plasma calcium.  a dose of 25 u was suffi-cient to increase the plasma calcium of the d-fedanimal.  these results are discussed in relationto the effects of vitamin d and parathyroid hor-mone upon mitochondrial metabolism.

chromosomal patterns in cancer patients during treatment .radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and throughshort-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can beassessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because ofthe large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the courseof treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variationsfrom the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structuralaberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grownprior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us todetermine the variation .stained preparations examined microscopically allow us to recognizethese abnormalities which are apparent before, during, and afterradiotherapy . the damage appears to be largely random in thechromosomes affected in the different cancers, and the specificaberrations differ from cell to cell . however, there does seem to besome correlation between the appearance of persistent aberrantchromosomes and their frequency . while the peak incidence or /plateau/may remain unchanged, the frequency may change .

4612. flow considerations in regional cerebral hypothermiait is suggested that low flows are dangerousand may cause anoxia either directlyor by interfering with cooling.  sixty dogshave been subjected to local cerebralhypothermia by the method of femoral tocarotid cooling of arterial blood with per-fusion at a predetermined pressure ratherthan predetermined flow rate.  the cir-cuit is described and its advantages forclinical use mentioned together with its in-accuracies as a method of scientific investigation.these are chiefly concernedwith maintenance of systemic blood pressurewhich may require the injection ofpressor agents.  evidence for reduction in flowat low temperatures is discussedand evidence presented that this is not only dueto increase in viscosity but thatthere is an active spasm, manifested by'rewarming humps' which occur in thecooling graphs.  mean carotid flow rateswere determined by a revolution counterattached to a pump of fixed stroke volume,the output of which was linked to the per-fusion pressure and thus determined by the resistance.the place of added co2is discussed particularly in relation to the fallin partial pressure which accompa-nies the cooling of the blood.  the addition of 5% co2did not increase total carotidflows.  halothane had been used as an anestheticbecause of its sympatholytic ac-tion.  it has increased flows by 37% andabolished 'rewarming humps'.  rheomacro-dex used as a priming fluid instead of bloodproduced increased flow averaging 75%but did not abolish spasm.  it is suggested thatcooling faster than 1 c. per minuteis not intrinsically dangerous if spasm is preventedand high flow maintained by the methods described.

further observations of the lymphomasof african childrenduring 1963, cytopathogenic, filtrable agents were frequently encountered incultures of embryonic human kidney cells following their inoculation withsupernatant fluids from primary human amnion cultures which had previously beenexposed to extracts of tumors and other specimens from east african childrenwith malignant lymphomas of the kind described by burkitt and others.  theresults seemed noteworthy because they suggested an intimate associationbetween the agents and the disease, and also because of the nature of theisolations which involved two phenomena, an initial induction of a peculiarspindling and twisting of the amnion cells(fig. 1) and subsequently destructive changesin kidney cells inoculated with fluid from such altered amnion cultures.  thedirect inoculation of embryonic kidney cells with extracts of tumors or bonemarrow never caused cytopathogenic effects nor did the isolated, transmissibleagents have the capacity to induce the amnion lesions.  nevertheless,the two effects were closely associated and clearly related to the specimens.the cytopathogenic agents were later cultivated on protein-rich media andfound to have the characteristics of mycoplasma.  they failed to inducetumors in a variety of animals, and serologic tests in which they served asantigen gave suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a relationship to thedisease.  the mycoplasma also failed to induce the amnion lesions caused bythe specimens.

use of a cross-circulation technique in studying respiratory responsesto co .the effect of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on ventilation wasinvestigated in cross-circulated dogs in which the recipient dog's headand neck regions were perfused by blood from a donor dog . hypercapniaof the donor dog was produced by administering co -o -n gas mixtures inthe inspired air . hypocapnia was produced by hyperventilating the donordog with the aid of a respiratory pump . when the donor dog washyperventilated, the ventilation of the recipient was maintained at orjust below its resting level and it was independent of the arterial pcoof the donor . the donor dog was apneic when the artificialhyperventilation was suspended and this response was not abolished byvagotomy . bilateral vagotomy caused an increase in ventilation in therecipient when its head was perfused by hypocapnic blood . bilateralremoval of the carotid receptors did not influence the response to coqualitatively although there was some reduction in the ventilation ofthe recipient to cephalic hypercapnia . the ventilation of the recipientdog was best correlated to the ph and pco of its cerebrospinal fluid inboth hypercapnic and hypocapnic states .

volkmann's ischaemiavolkmann's ischaemia is the name given to a sequenceof events originally described by volkmann in 1881.basically the condition consists of the replacement ofthe limb flexor muscles by fibrous tissue following injury orocclusion of the main arterial supply of blood to thesemuscles.  the condition is rare fortunately--mainly becauseof improved methods of prevention.  the flexor muscles ofthe toes are sometimes affected, but the commonest group ofmuscles so damaged are the flexor muscles of the forearm.total arterial occlusion to a limb for several hours usuallycauses frank gangrene; partial or total occlusion for shorterperiods may give rise to ischaemic contracture.  the muscles,being deprived of their blood supply, die and are sub-sequently replaced by fibrous tissue.  like all scars, the fibroustissue contracts, producing the complete picture ofvolkmann's ischaemic contracture.  the forearm is thin andwasted, and the fingers are held in flexion owing to theoverall shortening of the flexor muscles.  in severe cases, ifthe nerves are also affected or if the entire muscle mass isreplaced by fibrosis, the fingers may be totally paralysedas well.

617. maturation of postnatal human lung and the idiopathic respiratory distresssyndromematuration and pathologic alterations of the lungin 19 newborn infants who died of idiopathic respiratorydistress syndrome were studied by light-and electronmicroscopy.  normal lungs from 6 fetuses and 11 new-borns served as controls.  in all infants with idiopathicrespiratory distress syndrome, respiratory bronchio-les and alveolar ducts usually presented the histologicpattern of mature lungs, i.e. they were predominantlylined by type i cells, which also formed the epithelialcomponent of most blood-air barriers.  well expandedalveoli exhibited a similar pattern, whereas collapsedalveoli were lined by numerous type ii cells which par-ticipated in the formation of poorly developed blood-airbarriers.  the capacity of type ii cells to produce in-clusion bodies seemed to increase with survival beyondthe 14th hr of age.  secretion of inclusion bodies andpresumably surfactant into alveolar spaces did occurbut only in the lungs of infants older than 2 days.  how-ever, this process was not accompanied by reductionin the number of type ii cells per alveolus as in the nor-mal lung.  the distribution of pathologic changes in idio-pathic respiratory distress syndrome appeared to bedetermined by the degree of maturity of the air sacs.structurally mature air sacs were associated with da-mage of epithelial lining and hyaline membrane forma-tion.  in contrast, collapsed alveoli revealed an intactepithelial lining and marked septal edema but were freeof hyaline membranes.  the findings of this study sug-gested that transudation of plasma through well develop-ed blood-air barriers was responsible for epithelialdamage and hyaline-membrane formation in air sacs.they also suggested that alveolar collapse and presuma-bly lack of surfactant were related to abnormal matura-tion of the epithelial lining and to septal edema.

502. the haemodynamic implications of the bisferiens pulsea bisferiens carotid arterial displacement pulsewas recorded in 10 patients withsevere aortic valvular disease.  the braunwaldtest indicated that moderately severe,severe, or gross aortic regurgitation was presentin each.  the absence of a peaksystolic aortic pressure gradient in certain cases,particularly in those with themost severe regurgitation, suggested their freedomfrom an element of stenosis.the anacrotic wave and the peak of the aorticpressure pulse were found to coincidewith the percussion and the tidal waves of thesimultaneously recorded carotid ar-terial displacement curves.  it is suggested thatamplitude of the peak of the anacro-tic wave is proportional to the rate of change ofmomentum of the ejected blood, andthat the amplitude of the corresponding percussionwave of displacement is modified bythe distensibility of the artery.  the depth and shapeof the trough between the twopeaks is thought to depend upon the magnitude andslope of the two waves rather thanupon a venturi effect.  it is suggested that the conditionof the arterial wall, the dia-stolic blood pressure, and the stroke volume caninfluence the pulse sufficiently topreclude its use as a simple guide to the nature ofthe aortic valve lesion.

linfangiografia no estudo da filariase linfaticain the first part of the present paper a study is presentedof the lymphangiogram of the normal african; the author hasnoticed that it is coincident with the one of the white indi-vidual.the second part includes the lymphangiographic examina-tion and the observation of lymph circulation (via risa)during the several stages of lymphatic filariasis.even during the asymptomatic stage, lymphangiographyshows ganglial hypertrophy with a slight fibrosis and occa-sional discreet alterations of the lymphatic trunks.in the symptomatic stage, the lymphangiographic aspectsvary according to the disease's different stages and there isnot always a relationship between the duration period of thesymptoms and the changes observed.in lymphangites, there are frequent alterations of thelymphatic trunks, i.e., increase in caliber, extensive and seg-mentary dilatations, numerical decrease with visualization ofanastomoses and higher permeability.  circulatory trouble evi-dences itself not only by a decrease in the rate of the lymphflow, but also by a very marked ganglial retention.in adenites, in spite of the marked ganglial hypertrophydue to intense sclerosis, there may be no considerable altera-tions in the lymphatics, but risa already shows clear circula-tion troubles leading to lymphatic stasis.in adenolymphoceles, the obstruction at the primitive-iliaclevel causes the lymph flow to deviate through the pre-sacralanastomoses and reflux to the inguinal glands, thus causingtheir dilatation and the formation of varicosities in the affe-rent lymphatics.in lymphedemas, our lymphangiographic results togetherwith risa's allow us to assume that the pathogeny is chieflyinfluenced by three factors: lymphatic obstruction due to lym-phangitis, insufficiency of the collateral ducts, and ganglialsclerosis.

effect of abdominal operation on glucose tolerance and serum levels ofinsulin, growth hormone, and hydrocortisone.abdominal operations of moderate severity arefollowed by high fasting blood-glucose levels and a reducedtolerance to intravenous glucose which persistsfor at least 72 hours after operation.  fasting plasma-insulinlevels are raised after surgery.  intravenous glucoseproduces much higher levels of serum-insulin andgrowth hormone in the immediate postoperative period.corticotrophin infusion increases the plasma-hydrocortisonelevels and reduces glucose assimilation to agreater extent than operation, but has no effect on serum-insulinor growth-hormone levels.
