detection of pericardial effusion by radioisotope heart scanning .a marked difference between the cardiac silhouette on the six-footchest roentgenogram and the cardiac blood pool, determined by radioiso-tope scanning, has been shown to be consistent with pericardial effusionand/or thickening . it has also been observed that the cardiac bloodpool is separated from the liver margin by the interposition of peri-cardial fluid and/or thickening . this separation was not demonstratedin the presence of a normal pericardium . to appreciate these features,400 c. of radioiodinated human serum albumin and 50 c. of colloidalradiogold were used for scanning . the former outlined the blood pooland the latter demonstrated the position of the liver .

demonstration of ventricular aneurysms by radioisotope scanning .radioisotope scanning of the cardiac blood pool after the intravenousinjection of i -labeled iodipamide was carried out in 14 patients withventricular aneurysm . in 4, the aneurysm could be demonstrated onneither the anteroposterior chest roentgenogram nor the scan . in 5, theaneurysm was apparent on the radiograph, but the blood pool did notenter the area, suggesting a thrombus within the aneurysm . in 5, theaneurysm was detectable on the film and was also seen to be filled withradioactivity on the scan . presumably these findings showed that athrombus had not yet formed . blood pool radioisotope scanning appearsto be another tool in the diagnosis of ventricular aneurysm, useful alsoin demonstrating in some patients the presence or absence of anintraluminal clot within the aneurysm .

measurement of pericardial fluid correlated with the i -cholografin andihsa heart scan .in 23 patients undergoing open-heart surgery in whom the pericardialcontents were accurately measured, and in 11 additional patientsexamined at autopsy or by pericardiocentesis, isotopic photoscans of theheart were made and the results were correlated .the most accurate means of diagnosis of pericardial effusion was foundto be the ratio of the maximum transverse cardiac diameters on scan androentgenogram . in patients with less than 100 cc of pericardial fluidthis ratio was greater than 0.80, and it was less than this in cases ofeffusion of 200 cc or more .measurement of the difference of these diameters, and visibleseparation of the cardiac blood pool from the pulmonary vasculature andliver aided in the diagnosis .pericardial effusions of 200-300 cc or greater can be detected byisotopic photoscanning . although cardiac dilatation and/or hypertrophydecrease the sensitivity of the technique somewhat, a definite diagnosisof pericardial effusion can be made even when cardiomegaly exists .

tumor scanning with radioactive cesium .fourteen patients with cancer were scanned 10 minutes to 48 hoursafter injection of radioactive cs. and satisfactory scans of the tumorswere obtained in seven . positive scans were obtained in large,superficial tumors, in a pulmonary lymphoma, and in a carcinoma of theupper third of the esophagus . the negative scans were all in abdominaltumors . correlations were made with data obtained from externalcounting and by well scintillation counting of biopsy specimens . twomodes of uptake are suggested.. (a) early uptake due to vascularity andprobably not proportional to stable cesium content.. and (b) a lateruptake based upon greater alkali metal content of tumors than of normaltissue .

2497. pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septumwhen the pulmonary valve is atretic andthe ventricular septum intact, the rightventricle usually consists of a small chamberwith a very thick wall capable of de-veloping high pressure.  this pathologic pictureis associated with clinical findingssimilar to those in tricuspid atresia-cyanosis,decreased pulmonary flow, left ven-tricular preponderance on the electrocardiogram,and early death.  the diagnosismay be confirmed by heart catheterization andselective angiocardiography with in-jection into the right ventricle, but the risk isgreat.  surgery has never been suc-cessful in the past; but because of the equallyhopeless prognosis on medical treat-ment, attempts should continue to be made.anastomosis of the superior vena cavato the right pulmonary artery appears to offerhope of success in the future.

ventricular septal defect with aortic insufficiency a clinical andhemodynamic study of 18 proved cases .eighteen patients with the combination of ventricular septal defectand aortic insufficiency were studied . nine also had infundibularpulmonary stenosis . seventeen were treated by open-heart operations .the physical findings were those of a typical ventricular defectmurmur and thrill together with an aortic insufficiency blow and a widepulse pressure . a systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border withthrill is strongly suggestive of the additional lesion of infundibularpulmonary stenosis, but the presence or absence of infundibularpulmonary stenosis was indicated most accurately at cardiaccatheterization and on inspection at operation . it was not ofsufficient severity for signs of additional right ventricularhypertrophy to appear on the electrocardiogram .retrograde aortography serves to demonstrate the severity of theaortic regurgitation .the problem of the surgical correction of these lesions will be thesubject of a separate communication .

1106. the simultaneous use of extracorporal circulation and hypothermia in thesurgery of the heartthe operative technique of cardiacsurgery under conditions of deep hypothermia withsimultaneous use of a pump oxygenatorand cardiopulmonary bypass is described.  inthe majority of cases the patients werecooled with water at 2 c. and the perfusionvolume was reduced by more than 50%during hypothermia.  in others, a gradient of10 c. between blood and water wasmaintained and the perfusion volume was reducedby less than 50%.  the data presentedshow that neither technique leads to hypoxicchanges in the cerebrum and internalorgans, provided the mean arterial pressureis kept between 70 and 90 mm. hg during perfusion.the overall mortality in theauthors' 168 cases - most of whichhad congenital heart disease - was 14.8%.  in 53cases of tetralogy of fallot - mostof them cyanotic - the vsd was closed by takinga flap of tissue from the crista supraventricularis.in this group mortality was 24.5%.

the inhibition of cell aggregation by a pureserum proteinthe aggregation of embryonic chick and quail limb bud, heart and liver cellsin a shaker system has been investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism ofcell adhesion.a new method of assessing aggregation is described and evaluated; thismethod involved measurements of aggregation kinetics.  it was found that themeasured kinetics agree closely with flocculation kinetics, which provides adirect quantitative measurement of adhesiveness in terms of theprobability of an adhesion forming on contact between two cells.using this technique it was confirmed that aggregation is inhibited at1-2 c. in the presence of serum but not in its absence.  the kinetics ofaggregation in the presence of serum at 37 c., the lack of inhibition ofaggregation at 1-2 c. by serum which has been 'conditioned' by the presence ofcells, and the similar lack of inhibitory power of serum which has beenpre-treated with antiserum antibodies, all suggest that serum contains afactor which inhibits aggregation until destroyed by cellular metabolism.

surgical treatment of ventricular septal defect .the surgical technique of closure of ventricular septal defects in 80cases (37 cases of isolated defects and 43 cases of tetralogy of fallot)is discussed in the light of the follow-up results . the use of a patchfor closure has reduced the incidence of recurrence to 4 percent, com-pared with 18 percent when direct suture was performed . the incidenceof heart block also decreased from 15 percent, when direct suture wasused, to 4 percent with a patch . the transatrial approach is preferredfor isolated ventricular septal defects,. the ventricular approach ispreferred for cases with tetralogy of fallot . in cases combined withaortic insufficiency only small defects are closed through the aorta .larger defects are closed in the usual way at a first stage operation,and a total valve prosthesis is introduced at a second operation . therewas an operative mortality of 6 percent in isolated ventricular septaldefects, compared with 27 percent in cyanotic patients with tetralogy offallot .

surgical treatment of atrial septal defect under hypothermia .the technique of inflow occlusion under 30 c. hypothermia was adoptedfor direct visual correction in 133 consecutive cases of atrial septaldefect of the secundum variety and the associated anomalies .the use of extracorporeal circulation combined with hypothermia wasreserved for the repair of two cases of ostium primum defects .the over-all operative mortality was 4 .post-operative evaluation showed that the results have been good inalmost all patients, including those with pulmonary hypertension .since an ostium primum defect requires cardio-pulmonary bypass for itsclosure, the pre-operative recognition of the defect is highly desirablein the selection of patients for operation and in planning the procedureitself .the information derived from the clinical examination and appropriatediagnostic studies has been found to be consistently accurate in thepre-operative differentiation of the primum from the secundum defect .therefore, the unexpected discovery of a primum defect at operation wasnot a problem .in our experience, open-heart surgery under 30 c. hypothermia for therepair of an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and theassociated anomalies is a safe and practical technique and effectivelycorrects the anomaly with minimal risk .

2406. profound hypothermiathe aim of hypothermia is protection of vitalcerebral structures from hypoxiaduring aneurysm repair; profound hypothermiais also valuable in operating oncertain cardiac defects which cannot be repairedeven with whole body perfusion.since the time needed for aneurysm repair oftenexceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12minutes without circulation afforded by surfacehypothermia of 29  to 30  c., theauthors have investigated the drew (open-chest)technic, the closed-chest method,and isolated cerebral perfusion.  the drew technicconsists of substituting twopumps for the heart while the patient's lungs actas the oxygenator.  because of itsdisadvantages (the large amounts of blood neededand the morbidity due to intra-cardiac cannulation and median sternotomy), aclosed-chest method was developed,using a mayo-gibbons vertical-sheet pump-oxygenatorto provide the perfusion andextracorporeal cooling without requiring thoracotomy.in cerebral perfusion, bloodis taken from one artery, pumped through a heatexchanger, and returned to anotherartery.  the authors describe anesthetic technics,offer comparisons of the threemethods, give instructions pertaining to the productionof hypothermia, and list theproblems encountered in the management of these cases.

on early infantile psychosis.the symbiotic and autistic syndromesin conclusion, i wish to state that thecore of child psychosis mustbe sought in one or the other of thedescribed distortions of the sym-biotic phase.  in the first case, what layat the heart of the psychotic dis-turbance was the marked emotionalunavailability of the mother,which alternated with a purely physicalextreme closeness during thebreast-feeding situations, and particularlywith the destructiveness ofthe mother's unpredictable rage attacks.the contrasting experiencesdrove the child to the autistic wardingoff of any human contact andthe de-animation of the world of reality.constitutional factors couldnot, in this case, be evaluated with anydegree of accuracy.in the second case, it was, by contrast,the mother's ever-presencethat created an unendurable instrusionupon and interference withthe structuralization of the budding ego,which constitutionally andperhaps predispositionally may have beenvery vulnerable.  this madeit impossible for the infant to experiencethe normal alternation ofthe gratification-frustration sequences athis own pace; it also madethe process of individuation in theseparation-individuation periodone which was beset with abysmal panic.in both instances, we can see that it wasprimarily in the severe dis-tortions of the normal symbiosis that thechild psychosis had its roots.

the pathology of 'giant cell hepatitis' in early infancy.a 1-month-old male infant was admitted tohospital because of acute cardiac andcirculatory failure.  autopsy revealed macronodularliver cirrhosis with splenomegaly,left ventricular dilatation of the heart,hydrothorax, and ascites.  histologyof the liver showed a giant cell hepatitis.  theportal areas were widened, with fociof erythropoiesis and histiocytic infiltrations.the liver cells showed vacuolar anddegenerative changes.  the giant cells, presentin the margin of the regenerationareas, as well as in the degenerated lobuleshas irregular borders and varied insize from 45-60 ft.  their nuclei were large,sometimes bizarre.  their basophilecytoplasm showed granules of iron pigmentwhich was also found in some normalhepatic cells, in the prominent kupffer cellsand in the connective tissue.  in thespleen there were proliferation of connectivetissue and scattered areas of erythropoiesis,as well as pigment deposits in the pulpa.iron pigment was also found in thepancreas and salivary glands.  the islets oflangerhans were hyperplastic.  the etiologyof giant cell hepatitis is still unknown.its pathogenesis may be due to a malformation,immunologic response to some typeof antibody, inborn errors of ironmetabolism and viral infection.  it is suggestedthat the giant cell transformation isa response of the immature liver cell to a varietyof stimuli.  this case is of interestfor the predominance of giant cells with 1 or2 nuclei, presumably it is an intermediatestage or a variant of hepatitis.

974. extracorporeal hypothermia without thoracotomy.  an ex-perimental study in the use of cold for neurosurgery andcancericidal perfusionsthis paper includes minor clinical noteson open heart surgery and cancer perfusionbut contains no experimental informationon neurosurgery or cancer perfusions.  amethod of closed-chest hypothermic perfusionin 30 dogs is reported.  the authorsutilize drainage of superior and inferior cavaeby gravity.  the volume of venousdrainage sometimes enhanced by transfusionsor 12.5% low molecular weight dex-tran determined the flow rate.  cooling wasmaintained for quite variable periodsapparently generally to an unspecifiedesophageal temperature.  perfusion time va-ried from 30 min. to 4 hr.  animals withlow flows were perfused longer, had a high-er incidence of ventricular fibrillation,and a very low survival rate.  eleven ani-mals survived.  all had pre-cooling flowrates above 40 ml./kg./min., good flowrates during the perfusion, and only 3 hadventricular fibrillation.  flow rates andsurvival were increased in animals receivinglow molecular weight dextran.  four-teen of 15 animals with ventricular fibrillationwere defibrillated electrically, 8 re-gained 'adequate' cardiac function, but only 3survived.  some interesting data onregional cooling of the lower half of the bodyis presented.  the authors concludewithout sufficient evidence that the mostimportant factor in the mortality in hypo-thermic perfusion is the ability to maintain'a flow rate approaching the estimatednormothermic cardiac output of the animal'

2716. y-angiocardiographyrecordings were made, simultaneously withthe y-cardiogram, of a pulmonary an-giogram by means of a collimator placed inthe left scapular region and of carotidangiogram by a collimator centered on the axisof the external auditory canal.  the3 curves yielded very interesting information onthe chronology of the various car-diac cycles.  the pattern of the pulmonary andcarotid y-angiograms was valuablein several pathologic conditions.  it is more logicalto measure the cardiac outputon the carotid curve than on the y-cardiogram,especially if there are shunts.  thepulmonary curve allows rectification of the timeconstant of emptying of the leftcavities of the heart.  as regards chronologicinformation on cardiac cycles, atten-tion is drawn to the fact that in the pulmonarycirculation long and short circuitscan be demonstrated.  the characteristic timescan be measured.  between the timethat the radioactive material appears in the leftcavities and the time that it leavesthe carotid, there is an interval of 3-4 systoles,which represents the time neces-sary for left circular filling.  the validity ofcalculation of the cardiac output withthe stewart-hamilton formula is discussed.this is valid if the collimator coversa small volume of the principal channel.  it remainsto be shown if such a calculationis valid for larger cavities, or for 2 cavities, throughwhich the radioactive materialpasses successively, and which have different c (t)functions as well as for all tissue'seen' by the collimator, some of which are not yetirrigated with the radioactiveblood, while in other areas recirculation has alreadystarted.  these aspects, andtheir application to the pulmonary angiogram, arediscussed in detail.  with theauthors' technique, y-angiogram isespecially valuable, as correc-tion for the time constant of the decrease of the leftpeak is based on the lengtheningof this curve.  this again serves as a basis fordetermining the left ventricularvolume.

isozymes of lactic dehydrogenase.. sequential alterations duringdevelopment .applications of isozymes in various biological contexts have beenreviewed . diagnosis of several disease states has been facilitated byexamination of the serum isozyme pattern which has been shown tocorrelate in some conditions with the isozyme pattern of pathologicallyinvolved tissues . physico-chemical studies of human ldh isozymes haverevealed differences among isozymes in affinity for a given substrate .comparative studies of ldh isozymes within the erythrocyte from variousvertebrate species demonstrated a marked species variation in the numberof ldh isozymes, in the distribution of total ldh activity among them,and in their electrophoretic mobilities . during development of chick,rabbit, and human tissues characteristic sequential alterations in theldh isozyme pattern occurred and consisted for liver and muscle in lossof the most rapidly migrating anodal bands and increased activity in thecathodal bands and slower migrating anodal bands . in heart the reversechanges were observed . if high enough ldh activities of early fetaltissue extracts were applied to the gel the full complement of ldhisozymes was observed,. however, in lower concentrations the cathodalbands, which in the starch gel disappear more rapidly on dilution thando the anodal bands, were not observed . a species-specific isozymepattern is obtained in long term culture of rabbit, chick, and humancells . independently of the tissue of origin, there occurs in cells inculture a sequential series of isozyme alterations characterized bydecreased intensity of rapidly migrating anodal bands . the shift towardprominence of cathodal isozymes during both fetal development and tissueculture can be explained by postulating the increased activity of thegene producing one of the subunits of ldh with a concomitant decrease inthe activity of the gene producing the second subunit . practicalapplications of the study of isozymes in tissue culture were discussed .

3716. glycolytic control mechanisms. i. inhibition of glycolysisby acetate and pyruvate in the isolated, perfused rat heartacetate or pyruvate had similar effectson the over-all metabolism of glucose.  gly-colytic flux was decreased in both thepresence and absence of insulin, glucoseoxidation was greatly decreased, andthe conversion of glucose to glycogen and lac-tate was promoted.  glucose phosphorylationwas decreased in the presence but notin the absence of insulin.  hexokinase,phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde phos-phate dehydrogenase, and pyruvic kinaseare far displaced from equilibrium, whilethe other enzymic steps of glycolysisare maintained either at equilibrium or fairlyclose to equilibrium.  in different metabolicsituations, glycolytic flux may be affec-ted by those steps which are far displacedfrom equilibrium.  increased levels ofthe hexose monophosphates, and decreasedlevels of the other glycolytic inter-mediates between fructose 1,6-diphosphateand pyruvate after the addition of 10 mmacetate indicate that glycolytic flux wasdecreased by inhibition of phosphofructo-kinase.  after the addition of 10 mm pyruvate,fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and triose-phosphate accumulated as a result of aninhibition of either glyceraldehyde phosphatedehydrogenase or phosphoglyceric kinase.acetate had little effect on the total con-tent of oxidized or reduced di- ortriphosphopyridine nucleotides, but slightly de-creased the ratio of nad to nadh2in the cytoplasm, as estimated from the ratiosof lactate to pyruvate and a-glycerophosphateto dihydroxyacetone phosphate.  pyru-vate increased the total content of nadh2and nadph2 as shown both by an increaseof fluorescence in the intact heart, and bytissue analyses, but the ratio of nad tonadii2 in the cytoplasm was greatlyincreased.  these results demonstrate com-partmentation of pyridine nucleotidesbetween cytoplasm and mitochondria in theintact cell.  after the addition of acetate,citrate was the only intermediate of thecitric acid cycle which increased greatlyin amount, while oxaloacetate levels de-creased.  after the addition of pyruvate,the levels of citrate, a-ketoglutarate, ma-late, and oxaloacetate were all greatlyelevated.  the glutamic-oxaloacetate trans-aminase reaction as measured from thetotal contents of the reactants in the tissueremained close to equilibrium.  changesin the concentrations of the adenine nu-cleotides were insufficient to account forthe inhibition of phosphofructokinase, butthe results are consistent with control at thisstep being mediated by citrate.
