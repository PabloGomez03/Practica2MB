375. hemianopsia and glaucomaafter a discussion of the bibliographic references to the few observations onthe simultaneous occurrence of hemianopsias and glaucoma the author states onthe basis of his experiences the following points  homonymous hemianopsiasoccasionally take place in glaucoma, although no direct relation can beestablished between the former and the glaucoma.  it has to be pointed out,however, that in other older patients, for example in those with retinaldetachment, neuritis, etc. who are likewise subjected to repeated and exactperimetry, such hemianopsias do not occur, or are to be found at a lesser ratethan in glaucoma.  a homonymous hemianopsia has to be taken into considerationalso in the event of a sudden impairment of the visual field in a glaucomatouspatient or when the hemianopic defect supervenes in addition to the visualfield defect due to glaucoma.  in cases of binasal hemianopsia, thesimultaneous presence of glaucoma is not a rare incident.  whether thebinasal hemianopsia is the result of the gradual development of aglaucomatous visual field with nasal defects or whether it constitutes anindependent symptom to a certain extent, cannot always be clarifiedin the individual case.  obviously the condition of the basal cerebralvessels plays a certain role in the development of glaucoma, even ifthis role cannot be clearly defined as yet.  in cases ofbinasal hemianopsia, a glaucoma has to be ruled out before radical diagnosticand therapeutic measures are carried out.

on language disorders in young children: a reorganization of thinkingcurrent questions and confusions aboutthe use of the term aphasia with referenceto young children seem often toreflect semantic problems accruingfrom professional habits of thinking interms of etiologic and pathologic labels.it is argued that if the term aphasia isgeneralized simply to refer to inabilitiesor interferences in the development oflanguage comprehension and use, thenit is the task of an evaluating group todescribe as well as possible, and in detail,the specific impairments of functionin each child.  this task commonlyrequires the use of an extensive periodof "diagnostic teaching," wherein careis taken to explore which sensory andmotor modalities are working andwhich are not, and whether integrationof various stimuli is taking place.some current ideas are discussed withreference to descriptions of impairment,causal factors that are fairly unique inchildhood, some thoughts about theneurophysiology of the human "languagesystem," and some psychosocialfactors important for language-learning.special attention is given to various relations,in terms of temporal resolvingpower, between sensation and sensoryintegration.  a scheme, or model, is suggestedwhich may prove fruitful forexperimental design in attacking someof these problems at a prelanguage orpremeaning level.  it is argued that theproportion of "unknowns" can be reducedby careful study based on informationabout impaired functions within the sensory-integrative-motor complex,without particular regard for "site andextent of lesion."

1303. the problem of visual agnosiathis is a critical assessment of the ancient and modern theories on visualagnosia.  an original description of the subjective world of these patients isalso given.  visual agnosia is a rare disorder, but it has led to comprehensivediscussions, for instance, by the fact that the problem of normal visualperception is always involved.  bay's view, which denies the existence ofagnosia as a separate phenomenon in perception disorders, is especially dealtwith.  it is affirmed that no case has been described in the literaturein which visual agnosia is decidedly a pure and isolated phenomenon.mostly there are also disturbances in the intellectual interpretation of visualdata.  often there is metamorphopsia or asthenopia.  there is no localizedprestriate gnostic center for visual impressions.  the older concept of higherand lower levels of perception and perception disorders is also criticized.visual perception is not a passive, but a very active process, in whichneurophysiological and psychological aspects are involved.each of these can bedisturbed, leading to various degrees of visual perception disturbance.

387. ophthalmic manifestations of bilateral non-occipital cerebral lesionstwelve patients are described with neuro-ophthalmic symptoms resulting frombilateral cerebral lesions in areas other than the occipital lobes.  thesymptoms and signs are categorized as follows  group i  those showingpredominant disturbances in visual object recognition (visual agnosia) anddisturbances of visual spatial localization.  group iia  those having defectsin voluntary control of eye movements (ocular motor apraxia).  group iib  thosewith persistent palsies of conjugate gaze.  although these symptoms may bepresent to some extent with unilateral lesions, they are much more profoundand less able to be compensated with bilateral lesions.  the evidence in thepresent cases suggests a biparieto-temporal localization for the lesionscausing visual agnosia, disturbances of spatial localization, and ocular motorapraxia, and a more frontal localization for the lesions causing prolongedparalysis of conjugate gaze.

frontal lobes and vision .the influence of the frontal lobe on vision is discussed based on thepresentation of a rather unusual case . after the operation of a rightfrontal brain abscess, which never had led to papilledema, there was apronounced diminution of the visual capacities of the patient,.gradually these disturbances regressed to the point of return of fullvisual acuity,. but there remained a hemianopic field defect . this andpsychological defects in the sense of a partial visual agnosia (whichlatter are also regressing very well) prompted a discussion of thoseneuroanatomical and neurophysiological observations pertinent to thefindings in this patient . the many data on the fronto-occipitalconnections in subhuman primates point to the role of the frontal lobe(area 8) in the development of visual disturbances in the sense of atemporary hemianopia with partial visual agnosia and some intellectualdeficits . contrary to a single observation in an anthropoid ape, ourcase would seem to indicate that the aforementioned combination ofsymptoms may originate in the frontal lobe,. and we hope it will promptother long-term follow-up studies of similar patients . the continuedobservation of this patient and perhaps of others will give apossibility to gain insight into the role of the frontal lobe in vision,as has been assumed for animals .

visual neglect .clinical trainees in nursing and in psychology from boston college andsimmons college, boston, mass., collected data and observed patientsunder the direction of the authors in a pilot program designed tomeasure visual spatial neglect and to develop rehabilitative material .these measurements and exercises might also be used by nurses in theircare of those patients who have had cerebral vascular accidents .the diversity of daily activities in which the patient becomesinvolved during his hospitalization should provide some indication ofthe extent to which the compensatory visual neglect therapeutics havebeen effective . more formal estimates can be obtained byre-administering the battery of visual neglect tests at periodicintervals . nursing personnel adopting a program of therapeutics such asthis must bear in mind that patients suffering cerebral insult areusually less adaptive than their nonbrain-injured peers . they developnew habit patterns slowly and regression often will follow apparentfixation at a more adaptive level of response habituation(11) . however,experimental inquiry has shown that the dimension of behavioraldifference between the brain-injured adults and normal adults is one ofdegree rather than kind -dash a difference that skilled nursing canoften reduce(12) .

the ophthalmologist's role in the management of dyslexia .dyslexia is a clinical entity characterized by subnormal readingability in a person of average or above average intelligence .it is a disease which has different causes in different children . thecauses include brain damage in the /language area,/ hereditarypredisposition and such ophthalmic factors as hyperopia, muscleimbalance, aniseikonia or visual immaturity . emotional disturbances,educational immaturity and cerebral dominance may also play some role inthe etiology of this condition .the universal symptom is poor reading ability . however, these casesfrequently have other associated symptoms such as poor writing,difficulty in reading and writing numbers, inability to read or writemusical notes and disorientation for left and right . many of thesepatients develop personality maladjustments . visual fields often reveala hemianopia .in any group of poor readers, a large percentage will have ocular,neurologic, psychiatric or psychologic abnormalities and/or a stronghereditary tendency . the degree to which reading can be learned dependsupon the ability of the individual to adjust to the psycho-physiologicneeds that are present at the time he reaches /reading age/ in school .if compensating abilities are present, and if the child's reaction is afavorable one, he may read well in spite of unfavorable factors,. ifnot, he may become a /poor reader/ . these children should be recognizedin their first year of school .a complete medical work-up should be managed by an ophthalmologist . acomplete ophthalmic examination should first be performed and allpossible visual anomalies should be corrected . the ophthalmologist maywant a psychometric evaluation, a neurologic opinion to determine therole of organic brain damage, psychiatric consultation for evaluation ofemotional disturbances, pediatric consultation for evaluation of thestatus of the general health and/or consultation by an otolaryngologistto determine the patient's hearing ability . with all the necessaryinformation at hand, the ophthalmologist will be able to recommendcorrective medical therapy and to advise the parents and teachers aboutavailable remedial reading aids .the prognosis is good for most patients since they are of average orabove average intelligence,. nearly all cases can be helped .

the speech production and spoken language of the deafthe distinction was made between speech production and spoken language inanalysing the oral output of those with hearing impairment.  a brief review ofstudies in both areas was undertaken, including the report of a new electronicvisual monitoring device, the glossal transducer.  it was postulated that thedeaf utilise a unique visual-to-motor conversion within the brain when speakingand monitor conscously by tactile-kinaesthetic control.  the more recentstudies relate to the syntactical features of the speech of the deaf.  theseshow that deafness creates telegraphic speech with reduced sentence length andomissions of essential words such as functors.  the speech of the deaf seems tocontain mostly nouns and verbs, with a limited number of words used to expandverb forms.

1388. optic agnosia  semeiological and pathogenetic aspectsthe authors discuss the classical concept of agnosia and make a survey ofpathogenetical factors which determine its phenomenology.  the original andtraditional concept of such a term implied the loss of the capacity torecognize objects, when the functions of sense organs are undamaged.  thepsychological studies on perception and the modern physiology ofvision allow to avoid the dichotomy between sensation and perception andto affirm their identity.  cortex and recptors are closely bound andfunction in unison.every cortical alteration is thus reflected in sensorial functions; it istherefore that on practical semeiological grounds it is possible to obtain acongruous information of the corresponding cortical functionality through anexploration of sense organs carried out by suitable means.  since we areconfronted with functional changes, exploration methods must be fit to evaluatedynamic aspects of perception in connection with the temporalization andspatialization of stimuli.  such methods are now quite numerous and oftencomplex  a particular stress is laid on local adaptation, flicker fusion, andtachistoscopy on account of their significance and suitability.  by suchmethods it is possible to show those functional deficits or pathologicaldisturbances of sensorial functions which are also behind the pathology ofvisual recognition.  fluctuation, extinction, alteration in the perception ofmovement, both real and apparent, changes in adaptation to light anddarkness are all phenomena which can be detected instrumentally and which,at the same time, may be of determinant importance for the onset of 'agnosic'behaviour.  the complexity of the latter, on the other hand, cannot alwaysbe explained by sensorial disturbances only  other mechanisms, with a functioncomplementary but not less indispensable to the dynamics of perceptiveprocesses, may intervene and interfere in it.  on the basis of the latestneurophysiological data the attention is called to ocular motility andproprioceptivity, centrifugal innervation of sensorial receptors, andvestibular afferences.  a particular clinico-pathogenetical significance isattached by the authors to the association of lateral visual disturbances withaltered proprioceptive and kinesthetic information from the correspondinghalf-body  such association in fact is nearly always present among the factorsresponsible for the most strictly 'spatial' errors of 'agnosic' pathology.  inthe light of these pathogenetical considerations as well as of suitablesemeiological findings, the authors deem it convenient to divide their casesinto 3 categories with distinct clinical features  (a) cases in which alteredvisual behaviour may be related to changes of the visual function and of itscomplementary mechanisms; (b) cases in which hemianopia is associated witha homolateral deficit of somatic proprioceptivity; (c) cases in which thechanges in behaviour are chiefly, but not only, due to a dissolutionof the symbolic sphere.

the convergence and interaction of visual,auditory, and tactile responses in humannonspecific cortexthe relation between the electrical responses in the human brain andmental processes of integration and association is perhaps the most chal-lenging of all the problems facing neurophysiologists today.  until quiterecently the prospect of unifying physiological and psychological conceptsby electro-encephalographic (eeg) techniques seemed to be recedingbecause of the baffling complexity of the intrinsic electrical rhythms, andthis difficulty has still not been overcome.  the most intriguing, and atthe same time most elusive, of the properties of these rhythms is that,although often remarkably constant in their variations with respect totime, they fluctuate also, in a much less regular manner, within the threedimensional space of the brain.  the continuous analysis and display ofsuch a phenomenon presents serious difficulties, and no method has yetgiven entirely satisfactory results.the incentive to construct adequate equipment and to design and per-form crucial experiments is undoubtedly limited by the uncertainty asto whether the information likely to be obtained in this way is essentialto understanding brain mechanisms; few experimenters imagine that itwould be sufficient.

disturbances of the verbal body image.. a particular syndrome of sensoryaphasia .1. the pto syndrome of the dominant hemisphere varies according to theextent and depth of the lesion in the angular and supramarginal areas .the mildest clinical syndrome consists of a vague contralateral sensoryimpairment associated with dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia anddifficulty in naming . a more extensive lesion is needed to cause thewide variety of classical signs described in parietal lobe disease,among them being gerstmann's syndrome, which is usually found inassociation with other manifestations of parietal loss (case 1) . aneven more extensive corticosubcortical lesion in the area leads tocomplete disintegration of naming and understanding of speech (cases 3,4 and 5) .2. attention is drawn to the difficulties arising from lack ofdifferentiation between the concrete gnostic body image and the abstractverbal body image in investigation of these patients . the aphasicsyndrome should be differentiated from disturbances of gnosis byapplication of separate, non-verbal methods of testing to elicit theimpairment of the gnostic body image . the latter may be wellcompensated for and it is apparently unimpaired in the presence of anaphasic syndrome limited to the verbal body image .3. disturbances of speech in pto lesions if investigated alongquantitative scales of impairment of repetition, understanding andnaming, show a regular interrelation . nomination is the most affected,understanding is less affected . repetition is the best preservedfunction (cases 1-4) . the same interrelation of these functions isfound with regard to the verbal body image . however, understanding andnaming of parts of the body show far greater disintegration thanunderstanding and naming of any other categories of words (all casespresented here) . if the aphasic syndrome is subsiding, finger aphasiawith some other minor disturbances of verbal body image associated withacalculia may persist (case 1) . thus gerstmann's /finger agnosia/ mayrepresent a partial impairment of the verbal body image and be limitedto finger aphasia .4. it is assumed that the verbal body image differs from othercategories of verbal symbols owing to the mainly proprioceptive,vestibular and tactile experience forming its specific physiologicbackground . telereceptive experience is of minor importance in theinitial development of the understanding of words defining the bodyimage .in the patients described here, the selectively worse aphasicimpairment of the verbal body image, as compared with other categoriesof words, seem to confirm this assumption .

surgical treatment of atrial septal defect under hypothermia .the technique of inflow occlusion under 30 c. hypothermia was adoptedfor direct visual correction in 133 consecutive cases of atrial septaldefect of the secundum variety and the associated anomalies .the use of extracorporeal circulation combined with hypothermia wasreserved for the repair of two cases of ostium primum defects .the over-all operative mortality was 4 .post-operative evaluation showed that the results have been good inalmost all patients, including those with pulmonary hypertension .since an ostium primum defect requires cardio-pulmonary bypass for itsclosure, the pre-operative recognition of the defect is highly desirablein the selection of patients for operation and in planning the procedureitself .the information derived from the clinical examination and appropriatediagnostic studies has been found to be consistently accurate in thepre-operative differentiation of the primum from the secundum defect .therefore, the unexpected discovery of a primum defect at operation wasnot a problem .in our experience, open-heart surgery under 30 c. hypothermia for therepair of an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and theassociated anomalies is a safe and practical technique and effectivelycorrects the anomaly with minimal risk .

the applicability of individualized programed instructionin the education of deaf children.verbal behavior is learned behavior and assuch is guided by the same principlesas any other learned behavior.  the parents'role is mainly to help the young deafchild conceive of language as a socializingprocess and to help shape language behaviortoward the use of verbal symbols.the teacher's role in the deaf child'sprogress as a language user includes (1) helpingthe child discover how the structureof his language operates and (2) guidinghim in the process of acquiring clearconcepts.  the learning of a language is a highlyindividualized process and requiresthousands of hours of practice.  efficiencyin language teaching to the deafhas not been generally achieved by traditionalmethods.  the teacher of the deafneeds extra help in order to provide the individualistickind of teaching to insureverbal over-learning by the child.  self-tutoringprogramed materials offer thishelp.  programs are so constructed that a childproceeds through the program stepby step with a probability of maximum successbecause of constant feedback as tocorrectness of his responses.  for youngerchildren the use of a machine seemsdesirable while for older children the programmay appear in book form, on filmstrip, and any other visual medium.  well constructedprograms should be correlatedwith classroom instruction.

evolution of a characteristic speech disorder injuvenile cerebral lipidosisjuvenile cerebral lipidosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency inthis country, especially in schools for the visually handicapped.  themanifestations of rapidly developing loss of vision, seizures, muscularrigidity, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and eeg abnormalities are well known inthis disorder.  a speech disorder described as a "lolling, stammering speech"was mentioned by sjogren (1931) in his comprehensive descriptionof juvenile amaurotic idiocy, but this has not been emphasized inrecent descriptions.  this report, based upon an analysis of 5 cases,describes the evolution of a characteristic form of speech pathology thatis invariably present in juvenile cerebral lipidosis.the initial speech abnormality seen early in the disorder is a hesitancy ofspeech and occasional repetition of words.  in time, dysarthria becomesevident with slurring, nasality and impairment of phonation similar to thatseen in pseudobulbar palsy.  in addition to the dysarthria, a highlycharacteristic perseverative speech appears which often has a close resemblanceto true stuttering.  this stuttering-like speech has been observed in 4 of the5 cases at some time during the course of their illnesses.  as the speechpatterns deteriorate, the patient becomes less communicative and finally lapsesinto mutism.  the speech disorder is often the most disabling aspect of thissyndrome.

linfangiografia no estudo da filariase linfaticain the first part of the present paper a study is presentedof the lymphangiogram of the normal african; the author hasnoticed that it is coincident with the one of the white indi-vidual.the second part includes the lymphangiographic examina-tion and the observation of lymph circulation (via risa)during the several stages of lymphatic filariasis.even during the asymptomatic stage, lymphangiographyshows ganglial hypertrophy with a slight fibrosis and occa-sional discreet alterations of the lymphatic trunks.in the symptomatic stage, the lymphangiographic aspectsvary according to the disease's different stages and there isnot always a relationship between the duration period of thesymptoms and the changes observed.in lymphangites, there are frequent alterations of thelymphatic trunks, i.e., increase in caliber, extensive and seg-mentary dilatations, numerical decrease with visualization ofanastomoses and higher permeability.  circulatory trouble evi-dences itself not only by a decrease in the rate of the lymphflow, but also by a very marked ganglial retention.in adenites, in spite of the marked ganglial hypertrophydue to intense sclerosis, there may be no considerable altera-tions in the lymphatics, but risa already shows clear circula-tion troubles leading to lymphatic stasis.in adenolymphoceles, the obstruction at the primitive-iliaclevel causes the lymph flow to deviate through the pre-sacralanastomoses and reflux to the inguinal glands, thus causingtheir dilatation and the formation of varicosities in the affe-rent lymphatics.in lymphedemas, our lymphangiographic results togetherwith risa's allow us to assume that the pathogeny is chieflyinfluenced by three factors: lymphatic obstruction due to lym-phangitis, insufficiency of the collateral ducts, and ganglialsclerosis.

a behavioural and electroencephalographicstudy of autistic childrenshort biographies are given of 10 children,age 3 to 6 years, diagnosed as suffering fromkanner's syndrome (early infantile autism).an analysis was made of the free-field acti-vities of these children compared with a groupof normal children of similar age.  electro-encephalographic studies were also carried outon all 10 children, and in two it was possibleto carry out simultaneous behavioural andeeg observations by means of telemetry.the children were observed for three minuteperiods in four environments of varyingcomplexity: a. an empty room; b. the sameroom with toy wooden blocks present; c.blocks plus passive adult; d. blocks plus activeadult.  except in a the visual fixations andmanipulatory activities were of significantlyshorter duration in the autistic children thanin the normals, lacked clear 'cut-off' pointsand showed relatively little variability betweenenvironments.  the autistic children as awhole showed virtually no constructive play incontrast with the normals, though moretime was spent in contact with play materials inthe social environments.  changes in thetime spent in locomotion, gesturing, block-playand manipulation of other objects in theenvironment showed that the autistic childrenwere acutely responsive to changes in theirenvironment, including the presence of the socialstimulus.  if the autistic children weresubdivided into those who characteristically showedstereotypies and those who did not, thelatter sub-group showed a behaviour structure whichwas very similar to that of the normals,whereas the stereotypy sub-group was clearlydifferentiated from both the normal childrenand the non-stereotypy sub-group.eight autistic children had waking eegrecords characterized by low voltage irregularactivity without any established rhythms;one child, a record containing irregular alphaand another unstable theta activity.  two ofthe children with 'flat' laboratory eegs showedmore rhythmic, higher voltage records whentheir eegs were telemetred in environment a.they also showed less stereotyped behaviour.in environments b and d they showed pro-gressively more irregular eeg activity andmore stereotypy.the hypothesis is advanced that autisticchildren are in a chronically high state of physio-logical arousal.  the findings of the presentstudy and those of other workers are discussedwith respect to this hypothesis.
