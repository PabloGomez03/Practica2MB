influence of hormones on tumor growth and plasma prolactin levels in ratsbearing a pituitary "mammotropic" tumorthe effects of estradiol, cortisol acetate, thyroxine, or thiouracil ontumor growth, organ weights, and plasma prolactin levels were determinedin rats bearing a furth pituitary "mammotropic" tumor (mtt.f4).  thistumor is known to secrete large amounts of adrenocorticotropin, somatotropin,and prolactin, but no follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone,or thyrotropin.  at the dose levels used, estradiol significantly suppressedtumor growth without influencing body growth, and it partially inhibitedenlargement of the adrenals and atrophy of the thymus.  cortisol acetatesignificantly reduced both tumor and body growth.  thyroxine had no significanteffect on tumor growth but enhanced the somatotropic effect as indicated byincreases in body growth and organ weights.  thiouracil had no significanteffect on tumor or body growth, although it significantly increased thyroidweight.  estradiol, cortisol acetate, and thyroxine each increased the plasmaprolactin levels of the tumor-bearing rats.

influence of parathyroid activity on ionexchange in various tissues1. balance data from three patients with hypoparathyroidism, who weregiven parathyroid extract, are presented.  the metabolic response wascomplex.  the data demonstrate losses of phosphate, magnesium, sodiumand potassium which were not accounted for by destruction of either boneor non-osseous tissues.  preferential depletion of these minerals from bone,or loss from non-osseous tissues, must be presumed.2. the exchange of ca45, mg28, and p32 in a spectrum of rat tissues hasbeen studied in sham operated, parathyroidectomized, and parathyroidextract treated rats.  the effects of parathyroidectomy on the developmentof magnesium deficiency were determined.3. four hours after parathyroidectomy, increased transport of calciuminto bone, kidney, intestine, liver, brain, and muscle was found.  six daysafter parathyroidectomy equilibrium had been reestablished and exchangerates were identical to those in sham operated animals.4. the administration of parathyroid extract was associated with de-creased transport of ca15, mg28, and p32 into bone.  ca15 exchange in kidneywas reduced but in all other tissues exchange of ca15 and mg28 was in-creased.  p32 exchange in both intestine and kidney was mardedly increasedin animals receiving the extract.5. parathyroidectomy greatly minimized the manifestations of mag-nesium deficiency in young rats on magnesium deficient diets.6. the results suggest that parathyroid hormone may affect the trans-port and exchange of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate (and perhapssodium and potassium) in tissues other than those usually considered tobe target organs.

comparative bone marrow study using two aspiration needles and twobiopsy sites .bone marrow aspiration is now widely used in the diagnosis ofhematologic diseases and many conditions not primarily affecting theblood system . a number of techniques have been devised by which asuitable specimen of marrow can be obtained with relatively littlediscomfort to the patient . the two needle sets described in this paperhave been found to be equally reliable in obtaining bone marrow formicroscopic study and diagnosis . comparative studies of bone marrowaspirated simultaneously from the iliac crest and the sternum in 26patients show no significant difference . however, there were fourinstances of dry tap at the iliac site . this fact, in addition to theobservation that less discomfort was experienced by the patient when thesternum was used, might indicate that the sternal area is a morereliable and efficient site for obtaining bone marrow .it was also observed during this study that patients experienced lessdiscomfort when the university of illinois needle was used . the majorobjection to the use of this needle is the inability to obtain a bonecore for biopsy .

parathyroid function in chronic renal failure.  a statistical surveyof the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy.a collection has been made of 134 personal andpublished cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in whichadequate information was available concerning thepathological state of the bones.  measurements wereavailable of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, andblood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonateand plasma proteins in a representative sample.the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the wholeseries of 134 cases were not related reciprocally butwere correlated directly.  these data were further analyzedby allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups,according to the type of pathological lesions present inthe bones.  in one group there was evidence of defectivemineralization of skeletal tissues, in the form of eitherrickets or osteomalacia, and the plasma-calcium wasfound to be statistically sub-normal.  in the other groupthere was no primary defect of mineralization but thelesions of generalized osteitis fibrosa were present andthe plasma calcium was statistically normal.  there wasno significant correlation between the plasma levels ofcalcium and phosphate in either sub-group; and the plasmaphosphate was significantly higher in the group withthe higher plasma calcium levels.  the data indicate thatin patients with renal osteodystrophy, contrary to generalbelief, the plasma calcium varies independently of theplasma phosphate.  since these results imply differencesin parathyroid function among patients with azotemicosteodystrophy, a survey has also been made ofthe recorded parathyroid weights in chronic renal failure.generalized osteitis fibrosa and the accompanying normallevels of plasma calcium are associated with greaterparathyroid hypertrophy than is found in most casesof chronic renal failure or cases with defective mineralization.the various data are interpreted in relationto the known metabolic disturbances and natural historyof azotemic osteodystrophy.  by analogy with states ofsimple vitamin d deficiency, it is suggested that hypocalcemiaand relative unresponsiveness to the calcemicaction of parathyroid hormone are related to an acquiredresistance to vitamin d.  the group of cases with statisticallynormal plasma-calcium prove that the parathyroidglands can function effectively in some patientswith chronic renal failure, irrespective of the level ofthe plasma phosphate.  the size of the glands and theeffects of sub-total parathyroidectomy in patients of thisgroup suggest that the normal plasma calcium resultsfrom an increased production of parathyroid hormone.the more advanced renal failure in the normocalcemic,as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could meanthat the development of an effective degree of secondaryhyperparathyroidism is a function of the duration of therenal disease.  it seems likely that when the parathyroidresponse is sufficient to overcome the effects of the vitamind resistance it also entails the development of generalizedosteitis fibrosa, healing of the defect of mineralizationand increased liability to metastatic calcification.

815. the origin of macrophagesfrom bone marrow in the ratskin windows' and subcutaneous coverslipswere applied to rats in a study designedto identify the tissues in which the precursorsof macrophages proliferate.  lympho-cyte-depletion by either chronic drainage fromthe thoracic duct or 400 rads of x-irradiation failed to suppress the emigration ofmacrophages or to reduce the pro-portion of them which became labelled after aninjection of tritiated thymidine.  x-irradiation with 750 rads suppressedthe emigration and the labelling of the exudatemacrophages.  both were restored tonormal when the tibial marrow was shieldedduring irradiation.  radioactively-labelledcell suspensions obtained from thoracicduct lymph, lymph nodes, thymus, spleenand bone marrow were transfused intosyngeneic recipients.  the emigration oflabelled macrophages on to coverslipscould be demonstrated only in recipientsof labelled bone marrow and spleen cells.labelled monocytes were found in the bloodof rats which had received injectionsof labelled bone marrow.  it was concludedthat in the rat, bone marrow, and to alesser extent spleen, are major sources ofthe macrophages which emigrate intofoci of acute, non-bacterial inflammation.

stable strontium in human bone: geographical and agedifferences in the united kingdom and theircorrelation with levels of strontium-90a re-assessment has been made of published data of other workers on sr and90sr in human bone.  in different parts of great britain the mean ratio ofstable sr to ca in adult human bones rangedfrom 240 to 475ug/g.  extreme valueswere found even as close as 40 miles apart (carlisle v. westmorland).perinatal levels of stable sr were correlated with adult levels.  an estimateof placental discrimination may be derived from the ratio, perinatal level:adult level of about 0.7.the concentration of stable sr in bones of children from 2 to 5 years old ormore was not demonstrably different from that of adults except in one area,carlisle.  with the striking exception of london and south-east england thechange from perinatal to adult levels occurred in the 2nd year of life: therewas no particular change during the first 9 months or so.  in london andsouth-east england the pattern of change with age was quite different: therewas a progressive rise in sr level from shortly after birth to the end of the1st year by which time adult levels were reached.  it is concluded thatgeographical differences need to be taken into account when makingphysiological deductions about turnover of bone salt from changes with age inthe level of stable sr.when children in the south-east of england and the rest of the united kingdomwere compared, there seemed to be a broad inverse correlation between levels ofstable sr and of 90sr.detailed analysis of perinatal results from one area suggested that the levelof stable sr in bone was somewhat higher in summer than in winter and somewhathigher in anatomically normal babies than in babies dying with gross congenitaldefects.  90sr showed the seasonal change only.

functional craniology: an aid ininterpreting roentgenogramsof the skullanalysis of the form of the skull isfacilitated by considering it to be composedof a number of functional components.  forthe roentgenologist's purposes, division intothe facial or somatic skeleton and the neu-ral skeleton is valuable, as is the recognitionof three functionally separate portionswithin each calvarial bone: the inner table,the diploe and the outer table.the base of the skull is the only por-tion that is preformed in cartilage.  this ac-counts for the unusual appearance of theskull in achondroplasia.  in addition, thebase apparently is more closely related tofacial and general somatic growth than toneural growth.calvarial bone forms directly frommembrane within the cerebral capsule.consequently, the size and shape of the cal-varia directly reflect the form of the grow-ing neural mass.the inner table of the calvaria at allages is intimately related to the dura materand directly reflects the form of the duramater.  consequently, the inner table re-flects the form of the arachnoid mater and,usually, of the brain as well.the outer table of the calvaria servesnot only to protect the brain but also toanchor many of the intrinsic and extrinsicmuscles of the skull.  its form, particularlyin thick-skulled mammals such as the pig,is determined more by the demands of thesemuscles and of the scalp than by the formof the brain.the principal function of the diploeis to form a lightweight yet rigid separationof the two osseous tables.  in addition, itserves as a site of hematopoiesis; for thisreason it may tend to a specific volume at agiven age.the calvarial sutures oppose separa-tion of the bones of the calvaria while al-lowing relative motion between them.when the calvarial bones are passively car-ried apart with the expanding cerebral cap-sule by the growth of the neural mass, theirareas are increased by the deposition ofbone in the suture margins.  the sutures,however, do not function as epiphyses andhave no innate growth potential: removalof a suture does not disturb final skull form.because the calvaria represents ossi-fication of the cerebral capsule, it is smallwhen the neural mass is small.  the de-formity of the skull and the secondarychanges that occur in the air sinuses andthe diploe can be explained in terms ofthe functional cranial components.  the op-posite changes occur when the neural massis abnormally large.the correlation between skull size andintelligence is only fair.  the presence of abrain of distinctly abnormal size, however,may be inferred from plain roentgeno-grams of the skull.premature closure of the cranial su-tures may be due to an abnormal form ofthe cranial base and possibly of the primi-tive chondrocranium that precedes it.  theabnormality is mediated through the duralfiber tracts that underlie the major cal-varial sutures.

distribution of transfused tritiated cytidine-labeled leukocytes and redcells in the bone marrow of normal and irradiated rat .in normal rats and after total body irradiation with 550 r of x-rays,the fate in the bone marrow of labeled nucleated and red cells oftransfused peripheral blood was observed autoradiographically .labeled nucleated cells, most of which were lymphocyte-like cells,readily migrated into the marrow parenchyma in normal animals (2 cells/1,000 parenchymal cells/hr.) . following irradiation to at least 27-51hr., this migration appeared to be relatively increased . beyond thistime, parenchymal areas were more difficult to be defined as such .labeled red cells were rarely observed to enter parenchyma despite thepresence of nonlabeled erythrocytes within the parenchymal structureafter irradiation .the vascular bed following irradiation increased greatly as theparenchyma diminished to a minimum of less than 10 percent control at 75hr . despite these changes in the architecture of the marrow, theaverage density of labeled cells per area of marrow corresponded tovalues expected on the assumption of a free-flowing circulation . thetechnique used at present did not allow us to distinguish, at all times,between a free-flowing circulation through intact sinusoids or throughareas in which the sinusoidal wall, as such, was destroyed .

effects of parathyroid hormone and other proteins in vitroon mitochondrial metabolismit is apparent that in addition to parathyroid hormone, severalnon-hormonal basic proteins stimulate mitochondrial respiration, iontransport, and atpase, but inhibit the 32pi-atp exchange reaction.thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biologicalactions of parathyroid hormone as the previous reports suggested.rasmussen et al. (1964) have also isolated from parathyroidextracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrialtransport of phosphate in vitro.  they postulated that this proteinmight be yet another biologically important factor produced by para-thyroid glands.  the latter speculation may not be warranted in viewof the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria.  allof our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroidproteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically,or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone.further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determinewhether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validlyreflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is soundto use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.

acromegalythe effects of various steroid hormones on theinsulin-induced growth hormone responseand peter h. forshamthe availability of a sensitive assay for human growth hormone has madeit possible to directly measure the effects of various agents purported toalter growth patterns.  acromegalic patients present a special problem both inearly diagnosis and in therapy.  being able to measure growth hormone inthese patients provides an accurate index of activity and a precise measureof therapeutic effectiveness.in an attempt to determine whether a pituitary block of growth hormonesecretion is feasible in this condition, a study was made of the effects ofestrogen, androgen and glucocorticoid administration on growth hormoneresponse to a standard insulin tolerance test in a patient with active acro-megaly.  in the dosage schedules used in this study, it was not possible tosuppress either basal growth hormone secretion or blunt its responsivenessto the normal physiologic stimulus of hypoglycemia.

tissue distribution of electrolytes, ca and mg in experimentalhyper- and hypoparathyroidism.the effects of experimental hyper- andhypoparathyroidism on plasma and tissuedistribution of electrolytes and tissueexchangeability with ca and mg were studiedin dogs following acute renal pedicleligation.  in hyperparathyroidism, plasma concentrationsof mg and inorganic p aswell as ca were increased.  a greater accumulationof ca occurred in some tissuesand a lesser accumulation in others thanin acute hypercalcemia of comparableseverity and the fractional rate of exchangeof tissue ca was 30% more rapid thanin control and acute hypercalcemic dogs.bone exchange of ca was not significantlyincreased.  cell mg concentrations werenot appreciably altered by hyperparathyroidismexcept for a significant 9% decreasein myocardium, but the fractional rateof exchange of tissue mg was increased.acidsoluble p concentrations were decreasedin 3 tissues and na and c1 concentrationswere decreased by 10 to 25% in 4 tissues.in hypoparathyroidism, in addition to adecreased plasma ca, the incrementin plasma inorganic p that usually occursafter renal pedicle ligation was 75% lessthan in control dogs.  cell ca concentrationswere decreased by 10-40% but thefractional rate of exchange of tissue ca wasunaltered.  although cell mg concentrationswere unaltered a 40% increase occurredin the exchangeability of skeletal musclemg.  tissue na and c1 concentrations weredecreased by 20% in 2 tissues.  it has beenpreviously reported that hypercalcemiaincreases cell ca concentrations by raisingthe extracellular ca concentration gradient.evidence has also been presented thathypercalcemia directly inhibits cellinflux of mg and na and cell efflux of k.with altered parathyroid activity, 2 typesof effects are observed: those which aredependent upon an abnormal extracellularca concentration and those which appear tobe due to intrinsic effects of parathormoneon cell cation transport.  the presentdata are compatible with the hypothesesthat parathormone stimulates bidirectionaltransport of cell ca and p, stimulatescell influx of mg and opposes the effects ofhypercalcemia on cell transport of univalent ions.

2701. the role of certain additional factors in the development of amyloidosis,and its prophylaxis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)in patients with chronic fibrocavernoustuberculosis of the lungs, any toxic-aller-gic side reactions to antibacterial therapy,chronic foci or infection and diseaseswith an allergic component can contributeto the development of amyloidosis.  theearly detection and clearing of chronicfoci of infection and effective measuresagainst even mildly pronounced toxic-allergicside reactions are of prime impor-tance in the prevention of amyloidosis.  theunsystematic and prolonged administra-tion of antibacterial preparations, along withtheir toxic side effects, tends to in-crease the incidence of amyloidosis in patientswith chronic fibrocavernous pulmon-ary tb.  individual constitutional factors areof great importance in the developmentof side effects.  side reactions to chemopreparations,in cases of hypofunction ofthe liver and kidneys and autonomicdysfunction promote the development of dys-trophic processes, as is confirmedby the high frequency of toxic-allergic reac-tions in patients with fibrocavernouspulmonary tb who later develop amyloidosis.the administration of desensitizing drugsto patients showing side reactions there-fore helps to prevent amyloidosis in casesof chronic fibrocavernous tb, and chemo-therapy should be automatically combinedwith the administration of desensitizingand stimulatory drugs in this class of case.

hypoglycemia and dwarfism associated with the isolateddeficiency of growth hormone.the authors have studied a 7-year-old dwarfedboy with a history of severe, recurrenthypoglycemic episodes since age 1 andretarded bone age.  hepatic, adrenal,and thyroid function were normal.  he demonstratedfasting hypoglycemia with bloodsugars of 30-40 mg./100 ml.  he was not sensitiveto l-leucine but showed insulinsensitivity and hypoglycemic unresponsiveness.glycogenolysis in response to bothadrenaline and glucagon was appropriate.  fastingplasma gh levels were less than1 m g./ml. (normal 1-3), and no rise was seenafter insulin-induced hypoglycemia.similarly, these low gh levels did not rise 3-6hr.  after a glucose tolerance test.treatment with hgh reversed the alterationsin carbohydrate metabolism.  it isconcluded that the patient suffered from an isolatedgh deficiency which resulted indwarfism and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism.

2476. studies on cardiac dimensions in intact,unanesthetized man. i. description of techniques and theirvalidation. ii. effects of respiration. iii. effects ofmuscular exercisea method is described which permitsmeasurement of relative changes in the exter-nal dimensions of individual cardiacchambers throughout the cardiac cycle in intact,unanaesthetized man.  it consists ofsuturing multiple radiopaque silver-tantalumclips to the surface of the heart at thetime of cardiac operations.  in the postopera-tive period, cineradiograms areobtained and the distances between clips are mea-sured on each individual frame.this technique has been found to be safe and hasbeen employed in 68 patients withoutany complications.  as a result of studies in 8patients utilizing biplane serial exposures,the effects of rotation of the heart in thesagittal plane during the cardiac andrespiratory cycles were determined precisely.if clips were properly placed on the heart,the possible errors resulting from suchrotation were found to be quite small.during inspiration right ventricular dimen-sions increased, while the opposite occurredduring expiration and during the val-salva manoeuvre.  left ventricular dimensionsexhibited little change during normalrespiration.  during deep, slow inspiration,the changes in dimensions of the leftventricle lagged behind those of the rightventricle by 1 to 5 (generally 2 or 3) car-diac cycles; the magnitude of the changes inthe dimensions of the left ventricle wassmaller than that which occurred in the rightventricle.  the effects on ventriculardimensions of light muscular exercise performedin the supine position were studiedin 9 patients.  the end-diastolic dimensionsdecreased by an average of 6.0% of con-trol in the right ventricle, and by an average of5.1% in the left ventricle.  end-sys-tolic dimensions decreased by an average of 5.6%of control in the right ventricleand by an average of 6.5% in the left ventricle.these decreases are considered toapproximate one-half of the resting stroke volume.in the 4 patients in whom therate of right ventricular pressure rise was determinedcontinuously, exercise re-sulted in an elevation of dp/dt while ventricularend-diastolic dimensions decreased.these data are interpreted to indicate that anincrease in myocardial contractilityoccurs during muscular exercise in man.

resistance to human growth hormone in pituitary dwarfism:clinical and immunologic studiesthirteen pituitary dwarfs havebeen treated with human growth hormone(hgh), and growth acceleration with doses of5-7 mg/week has been observed in all but onepatient.  on therapy, this 7 1/2-year-old girl grewat a rate of 1.05 cm/month for 7 months.thereafter, despite larger doses of growthhormone (15 mg/week), growth rate fell to0.27 cm/month.  this rate of growth persistedafter stopping hgh.  on retreatment on 2occasions, acceleration of growth did notoccur.  antibodies to hgh, absent in herserum before treatment, were repeatedlydemonstrated in her serum in high concentra-tion (hgh binding capacity up to 100 mg/1)during treatment.  comparable titers of anti-body have not been found in any of the 12other patients receiving long-term hgh treat-ment.  the specificity of the human anti-hghserum differed from rabbit anti-hgh serum.whereas both monkey growth hormone(mgh) and hgh were effective inhibitors ofthe binding of hgh-131i by rabbit antiserum,only hgh was an effective inhibitor withhuman antiserum.  in like manner, a crudeplacental extract which was an effective in-hibitor for rabbit antiserum was ineffectivewith human anti-hgh serum.

2803. effect of dosage on endotoxin-induced changes in the reticuloendothelialsystem of rabbitstissues were removed from rabbits 4and 24 hr. following an i.v. injection of 5,25, or 200 ug of endotoxin.  explants oftissues from normal and injected animalswere grown in a coagulated plasma mediumand in medium containing 1 ug/ml ofendotoxin.  the migration and growth of cellswere observed during the following weekof incubation.  the inhibition or stimulationof cells of the reticuloendothelial system(res) at different host sites after endotoxinadministration depended on the dosageand on the known capacity of different organsto take up circulating endotoxin.  macro-phage migration was suppressed in culturesof spleen removed 4 hr. after a dose ofhibited by 200 ug, but macrophages inlymph node, testis, and thymus showed an in-crease in numbers, in extent of migrationand in phagocytic activity.  widespreadres stimulation was seen in tissues removed24 hr after the largest dose.  in ad-dition to the restoration of re cell activity inspleen and lung there was a markedincrease in the migration of large phagocyticcells from bone marrow, as well asother organs.  macrophages from endotoxin-injectedanimals were as sensitive asnormal macrophages to added endotoxin in vitro.

198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note ofcautionazathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classifiedas 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects ofazathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because ofthe concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during theadministration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolongedsteroid therapy.  in 1 patient, the administration of azathioprine wasassociated with amelioration of an arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum which didnot respond to the use of steroids and other medication.  immuno-suppressiveobservations were limited.  the established delayed hypersensitivity response,as reflected in various skin tests, was unchanged during the administration ofazathioprine.  azathioprine had no discernible toxic effects upon the kidneysor the liver in 2 patients, 1 with postnecrotic cirrhosis and the other withserum hepatitis.  gastro-intestinal symptoms (anorexia, epigastric discomfort,and nausea) occurred in 8 patients.  mild to moderate leukopenia developed in 8patients and, in 2 individuals, was accompanied by thrombocytopenia.  temporaryalopecia occurred in 1 woman.  the hematopoietic effects developed within 2 or3 wk of therapy with azathioprine at a dosage level of 4-6 mg/kg/day.azathioprine does not exert the rapid beneficial effect in ulcerative colitisnoted with corticotropin and adrenal corticosteroids.  therefore, its use insevere ulcerative colitis requiring intensive therapy probably is undesirable.azathioprine, on the basis of these initial observations, may be considered formoderately severe ulcerative colitis, under circumstances permitting controlledand prolonged therapeutic trial as adjunct medication, but with carefulsupervision for prevention of toxicity, especially leukopenia.

further observations of the lymphomasof african childrenduring 1963, cytopathogenic, filtrable agents were frequently encountered incultures of embryonic human kidney cells following their inoculation withsupernatant fluids from primary human amnion cultures which had previously beenexposed to extracts of tumors and other specimens from east african childrenwith malignant lymphomas of the kind described by burkitt and others.  theresults seemed noteworthy because they suggested an intimate associationbetween the agents and the disease, and also because of the nature of theisolations which involved two phenomena, an initial induction of a peculiarspindling and twisting of the amnion cells(fig. 1) and subsequently destructive changesin kidney cells inoculated with fluid from such altered amnion cultures.  thedirect inoculation of embryonic kidney cells with extracts of tumors or bonemarrow never caused cytopathogenic effects nor did the isolated, transmissibleagents have the capacity to induce the amnion lesions.  nevertheless,the two effects were closely associated and clearly related to the specimens.the cytopathogenic agents were later cultivated on protein-rich media andfound to have the characteristics of mycoplasma.  they failed to inducetumors in a variety of animals, and serologic tests in which they served asantigen gave suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a relationship to thedisease.  the mycoplasma also failed to induce the amnion lesions caused bythe specimens.

effects of adrenalectomy onthe parathyroids in nephrectomized ratsrat parathyroids were studied both after nephrectomy and after com-bined nephrectomy and adrenalectomy.  as early as 24 hours afternephrectomy there were morphological indications of increased para-thyroid activity in the form of increased glandular volume and enlargedcell nuclei.  the corresponding changes after combined nephrectomy andadrenalectomy were less marked and the total serum calcium was higherthan after nephrectomy only.  these observations suggest that the adrenalscould induce a change in calcium homeostasis opposite to that of theparathyroids.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero andin vitro with rubella virus.a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomeswas undertaken to determine if damageto the genetic apparatus of human cells maybe induced by rubella virus and whethersuch damage produces the pathology seenin newborns from mothers infected earlyin pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains wereinitiated in vitro from embryonic materialobtained by therapeutic abortion of fetusesfrom rubella-infected mothers.  embryonicmaterial from spontaneous and non-rubellatherapeutic abortions yielded similarcell strains for infection in vitro.  theresults from both types of studies were asfollows: (a) virus shedding cell strains wereobtained from all types of organs cultivated,which indicated wide disseminationof virus in the fetuses from rubella-infectedmothers.  (b) chronic infection couldreadily be established by in vitro infectionand no cytopathic effect was noted.(c) although many strains continued to shedvirus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,no changes in growth propertiesoccurred with the exception that infectedstrains from lung tissue showed limitedgrowth capacities.  (d) from observationsof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obviouschromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctionalchanges were observed instrains infected naturally or experimentally.(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derivedcell strains there was a marked elevationin frequency of chromosome breakage in3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlationbetween virus shedding in vitro andincreased chromosome breakage was notedalthough this was not complete.  (g) thecombined average frequency of chromosomebreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortionstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortusstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,but significant elevation in average chromosomebreak frequency (9.8%) was obtainedin four cell strains which had been experimentallyinfected in vitro with rubella virus(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effectsupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,these were restricted to slight general elevationsin frequency of breakage abovenormal values.  very high increases in breakswere sporadic.  it appears more likelythat the general fetal abnormalities associatedwith rubella infection in vivo resultfrom possible effects of the virus upon growthrather than from effects upon thechromosomes.  however, the studies wererestricted to fibroblasts cultured invitro; and effects on other types of cellsmay have greater implications for thisquestion.

verbal effects in the intermediate-size transportation problempreschool children were given an intermediate-size discrimination problem,told before each response that the reward was under the "medium" stimulus:and 1- and 3-step transposition tests.  during training, group i wasgroup ii was told that it was "not under the big or little one"; and groupiii was not told anything.  the verbalizations were not given during thetests.  groups i and ii learned the initial discrimination faster than groupiii, and transposed more than group iii, but there was a distance effectin all three groups.  these results, and other data, suggest that thedeficiency in the verbal control over motor behavior in young children arisesfrom deficiencies in both the decoding and encoding processes.
