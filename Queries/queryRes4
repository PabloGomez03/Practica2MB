bacteriophages that lyse mycobacteria and corynebacteria, and showcytopathogenic effect on tissue cultures of renal cells of cercopithecusaethiops.. a preliminary communication .bacteriophages isolated from sputum and resection specimens of pa-tients suffering from carcinoma of the lung were found to lyse coryne-bacteria and mycobacteria, and to produce a cytopathogenic effect oncertain cells in tissue cultures . from the same and other patients withneoplastic disease, bacteria were isolated and described as coryne-my-cobacteria because of bacteriological features they shared with bothspecies . these bacteria, which either were sensitive to mycobacterio-phages and corynebacteriophages or were phage-immune lysogenic bacteria,could be induced to produce lytic particles with phagolytic activity oncorynebacteria and mycobacteria and a cytopathogenic effect on helacells and on the renal cells of cercopithecus .

2379. in-vitro culture of pulmonary tumors in hamsters caused by adenovirus 12it is known that the adenoviruses 12 and18 provoke malignant tumors in thenew-born hamster.  the authors made a studyof the histogenesis of these tumors andexamined the specific changes brought aboutin the cells by the virus infectionmalignancy, presence of viral antigen, reactionsto superinfection.  when new-bornhamsters were inoculated in the chest withadenovirus 12, malignant tumorsdeveloped in one or two months, in 16 animalsout of 22.  these tumors presentedan epithelial aspect and were of bronchiolo-alveolarorigin.  they were transplant-able in vivo; if they were cultured in vitro,they consisted in the first few cultures ofmacrophages, fibroblasts and epithelium.in subsequent passages, there was aprogressive disappearance of the macrophagesand fibroblasts.  in some cases, theculture after seven passages was of a purelyepithelial nature, and when it wasreimplanted into hamsters at this time itgave rise to the rapid development of anepithelial tumor.  in the tumor cultures,no adenovirus could be demonstrated.nor could cultures of the pulmonary tumors,or cultures of normal hamster lung beinfected with adenovirus.  it appears that thelung of the hamster in an organotyp-ical culture constitutes a means of choicefor the malignant transformation ofadenovirus 12.

electron microscopic studies of mycoplasma (pplo strain 880) inartificial medium and in tissue culture.mycoplasma strain 880, isolated from a leukemicpatient, was studied in brothcultures and in several cell culture lines.this strain exhibited considerable pleomorphismin size, internal structure, andshape, including forms with filamentousprojections.  the most common form observedwas 0.5 to 1 in diameter andhad a nuclear area of fibrillar strands, probablydna.  the cytoplasm of the organismscontained ribosome-like granules anda flattened vacuole which indented thenuclear area.  there were various other forms,including 'elementary bodies' 100min diameter that were very electron-dense.in the tissue culture lines in whichthe cells grew as a monolayer, the mycoplasmawere closely associated with thecell surface and were occasionally seen inmembrane-lined cytoplasmic vacuoles.in cell lines that did not attach to the glass,the mycoplasma were fewer and notattached to the cell surface.  although theultrastructure of this strain is similarto that of previously described strains, thereare differences in details of structurewhich may be related either to the growthconditions used or to characteristics ofthe strain.  the various forms of the organismare consistent with the suggestionthat mycoplasma may have several mechanismsof reproduction (growth).  the intracellularmycoplasma may be protected fromantibiotics.  this would partly explainthe difficulty of eradicating mycoplasma frominfected cell cultures.

palliation by radiotherapythe purpose of radiotherapy in the managementof cancer of the lung is first to cure the disease;second, to prolong useful and comfortable exist-ence; and third, to provide comfort and relief ofsuffering to those who are symptomatic and in-curable.cancers of the lung vary quite widely in theirresponse to radiation.  those of glandular origin,the adenocarcinoma, are more often than not ofmodest susceptibility and sometimes quite resis-tant.  the very undifferentiated, the so-called oat-cell cancers, are often of exquisite sensitivity, re-sponding to irradiation almost like lymphomas.most cancer of the lung, however, is squamous-cellcarcinoma and as such may be considered to bemoderately radiosensitive in much the same orderof magnitude as squamous-cell carcinoma of theskin, cervix or larynx, and should, in theory, becurable by this means in the same degree.  unfor-tunately, this has to date not been found to betrue.  the reasons are principally two: first andforemost, by the time a diagnosis is made, cancerof the lung has more often than not, estimated at80% and more, spread beyond the site of origin,thus making cure by any effective means presentlyavailable unlikely.  second, the substrate in whichthe cancer grows, the lung, tolerates radiation lesswell than do the tissues which surround the highlyradiocurable epithelial cancers such as carcinoma ofthe skin, cervix, and larynx, thus making an un-favorable therapeutic ratio.

isozymes of lactic dehydrogenase.. sequential alterations duringdevelopment .applications of isozymes in various biological contexts have beenreviewed . diagnosis of several disease states has been facilitated byexamination of the serum isozyme pattern which has been shown tocorrelate in some conditions with the isozyme pattern of pathologicallyinvolved tissues . physico-chemical studies of human ldh isozymes haverevealed differences among isozymes in affinity for a given substrate .comparative studies of ldh isozymes within the erythrocyte from variousvertebrate species demonstrated a marked species variation in the numberof ldh isozymes, in the distribution of total ldh activity among them,and in their electrophoretic mobilities . during development of chick,rabbit, and human tissues characteristic sequential alterations in theldh isozyme pattern occurred and consisted for liver and muscle in lossof the most rapidly migrating anodal bands and increased activity in thecathodal bands and slower migrating anodal bands . in heart the reversechanges were observed . if high enough ldh activities of early fetaltissue extracts were applied to the gel the full complement of ldhisozymes was observed,. however, in lower concentrations the cathodalbands, which in the starch gel disappear more rapidly on dilution thando the anodal bands, were not observed . a species-specific isozymepattern is obtained in long term culture of rabbit, chick, and humancells . independently of the tissue of origin, there occurs in cells inculture a sequential series of isozyme alterations characterized bydecreased intensity of rapidly migrating anodal bands . the shift towardprominence of cathodal isozymes during both fetal development and tissueculture can be explained by postulating the increased activity of thegene producing one of the subunits of ldh with a concomitant decrease inthe activity of the gene producing the second subunit . practicalapplications of the study of isozymes in tissue culture were discussed .

chromosomal patterns in cancer patients during treatment .radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and throughshort-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can beassessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because ofthe large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the courseof treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variationsfrom the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structuralaberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grownprior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us todetermine the variation .stained preparations examined microscopically allow us to recognizethese abnormalities which are apparent before, during, and afterradiotherapy . the damage appears to be largely random in thechromosomes affected in the different cancers, and the specificaberrations differ from cell to cell . however, there does seem to besome correlation between the appearance of persistent aberrantchromosomes and their frequency . while the peak incidence or /plateau/may remain unchanged, the frequency may change .

mammalian cell cultures contaminated withpleuropneumonia-like organismsii. effect of pplo on cell morphology in establishedmonolayer culturesthe occurrence of cytopathogenic changes in monolayer cultures ofpplo-contaminated mammalian cells has been shown to be related todeficiency of arginine in the medium.  the same effects were seen when thecell culture medium was depleted by pplo prior to application to pplo-freecell cultures even though viable pplo were no longer present.  the fact thatthe same picture resulted in the absence of pplo when either arginine orglucose were omitted from the medium would indicate that, while the defi-ciency created under the conditions described was specific, the cellularchanges could as well be the result of omission or depletion of other mam-malian cell growth requirements.  the importance of surveillance of celllines for the presence of pplo to avoid misinterpretation of cytopathogeniceffects was stressed.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero andin vitro with rubella virus.a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomeswas undertaken to determine if damageto the genetic apparatus of human cells maybe induced by rubella virus and whethersuch damage produces the pathology seenin newborns from mothers infected earlyin pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains wereinitiated in vitro from embryonic materialobtained by therapeutic abortion of fetusesfrom rubella-infected mothers.  embryonicmaterial from spontaneous and non-rubellatherapeutic abortions yielded similarcell strains for infection in vitro.  theresults from both types of studies were asfollows: (a) virus shedding cell strains wereobtained from all types of organs cultivated,which indicated wide disseminationof virus in the fetuses from rubella-infectedmothers.  (b) chronic infection couldreadily be established by in vitro infectionand no cytopathic effect was noted.(c) although many strains continued to shedvirus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,no changes in growth propertiesoccurred with the exception that infectedstrains from lung tissue showed limitedgrowth capacities.  (d) from observationsof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obviouschromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctionalchanges were observed instrains infected naturally or experimentally.(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derivedcell strains there was a marked elevationin frequency of chromosome breakage in3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlationbetween virus shedding in vitro andincreased chromosome breakage was notedalthough this was not complete.  (g) thecombined average frequency of chromosomebreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortionstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortusstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,but significant elevation in average chromosomebreak frequency (9.8%) was obtainedin four cell strains which had been experimentallyinfected in vitro with rubella virus(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effectsupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,these were restricted to slight general elevationsin frequency of breakage abovenormal values.  very high increases in breakswere sporadic.  it appears more likelythat the general fetal abnormalities associatedwith rubella infection in vivo resultfrom possible effects of the virus upon growthrather than from effects upon thechromosomes.  however, the studies wererestricted to fibroblasts cultured invitro; and effects on other types of cellsmay have greater implications for thisquestion.

the behavior of lymphocytes in primary explants of human lung cancer invitro .the activity of lymphocytes within outgrowths from explanted tissuefragments of 20 human lung cancers has been studied . the study includedcancer-bearing tissue explants from all cases and noncancerbearing lungtissue from 4 of the 20 cases . five major categories of lymphocyticbehavior were derived from the study, namely.. (1) emigration andmigration of lymphocytes from the explant,. (2) clustering oflymphocytes around /target/ cells,. (3) ameboid transformation oflymphocytes,. (4) lymphocytic congregation,. and (5) emperipolesis .criteria for these different lymphocytic activities have been amplifiedor introduced .findings of particular interest were.. (1) the frequency of both viable and nonviable lymphocytes within the vacuoles of other cells . thisobservation is considered to be an absolute criterion for the recogni-tion of emperipolesis . a subsequent /inclusionbody/ appearance of thedead lymphocytes has been observed . (2) the intimate relationship ofameboid forms of lymphocytes to selected cells, resulting in ajuxtanuclear and frequently unipolar crowding of one cell by numerouslymphocytes while nearby cells were totally devoid of ameboidlymphocytes . reasons are given to support the impression that thisphenomenon is re lated to sensitization . there is also the possibilitythat the phenomenon may indicate that the lymphocyte is /conditioned/ .(3) the apparent entry of the lymphocyte into the cell has been recordedby timelapse cinematography .a lymphocyte relationship to cancer cells was infrequently foundalthough explants of 15 of the 20 cases produced identifiable cancercells and lymphocytes emigrated from the explants of all 20 cases . itis not apparent from this limited study whether this is a significantfinding .

1688. surface phenomena in lungs in health and diseasein summary, the authors have attemptedto bring together the multiple observationswhich seem germane to the understandingof surface phenomena in lungs in healthand disease.  to this end, the contributionsof anatomists and pathologists on thefine structure of alveolar cells and theirlining are fundamental.  the concepts ofalveolar stability required the specialinsights of physiologists who were concernedwith the causes of bubble stability asthey related to the particular problems posedby a lung of several millions of bubblesarranged in parallel.  soon the contributionsof the chemists became significant asmethods of identification and assay of the al-veolar lining material were of interest.clinicians asked what relevance these studieshad to atelectasis as it occurs in disease,and soon the question of when the surfac-tant appeared in development occurred tothose concerned with premature infants.students of metabolism began to focus onthe lung as a site of phospholipid synthesis,and their tools seem most promising atthis time in unearthing possible errors inmetabolism which may express themselvesin disease.  surgeons who undertake per-fusion of the isolated lung ask therequirements of that organ with respect to thenutrients and environment of the alveolarcells, and anesthesiologists inquire intothe possibilities of mechanical injuryto the alveoli during artificial respiration.the problems posed to the reviewersof a subject which touches so many disciplinesare obvious.  doubtless some pertinentstudies have been omitted although uninten-tionally; others may have beenmisinterpreted through lack of qualifications as spe-cialists in all specialties.  theauthors hope they have provided evidence that theforces of surface tension cannotbe ignored in an organ with an air-liquid interfaceof some 70 m2.  they further hopethey have described some of the properties ofthe film at the alveolar-air interfacewhich operate to produce stability of the alveoli.they hold the belief that study of themetabolism of the alveolar lining layer willfurther their understanding of a numberof disease processes in which it may bealtered.  and lastly, they hope for muchcloser communication between workers inmany disciplines who can elucidate thisremarkable subject best through cooperativestudies.

617. maturation of postnatal human lung and the idiopathic respiratory distresssyndromematuration and pathologic alterations of the lungin 19 newborn infants who died of idiopathic respiratorydistress syndrome were studied by light-and electronmicroscopy.  normal lungs from 6 fetuses and 11 new-borns served as controls.  in all infants with idiopathicrespiratory distress syndrome, respiratory bronchio-les and alveolar ducts usually presented the histologicpattern of mature lungs, i.e. they were predominantlylined by type i cells, which also formed the epithelialcomponent of most blood-air barriers.  well expandedalveoli exhibited a similar pattern, whereas collapsedalveoli were lined by numerous type ii cells which par-ticipated in the formation of poorly developed blood-airbarriers.  the capacity of type ii cells to produce in-clusion bodies seemed to increase with survival beyondthe 14th hr of age.  secretion of inclusion bodies andpresumably surfactant into alveolar spaces did occurbut only in the lungs of infants older than 2 days.  how-ever, this process was not accompanied by reductionin the number of type ii cells per alveolus as in the nor-mal lung.  the distribution of pathologic changes in idio-pathic respiratory distress syndrome appeared to bedetermined by the degree of maturity of the air sacs.structurally mature air sacs were associated with da-mage of epithelial lining and hyaline membrane forma-tion.  in contrast, collapsed alveoli revealed an intactepithelial lining and marked septal edema but were freeof hyaline membranes.  the findings of this study sug-gested that transudation of plasma through well develop-ed blood-air barriers was responsible for epithelialdamage and hyaline-membrane formation in air sacs.they also suggested that alveolar collapse and presuma-bly lack of surfactant were related to abnormal matura-tion of the epithelial lining and to septal edema.

(a) explantationinto several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed byreimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantationfollowed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity .specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lensmaterial of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serialsections . the results were interpreted as follows..1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium,embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount ofindependent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they failto undergo any fiber formation .2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explantswill respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellulardifferentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changesnecessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support theseresponses .3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficientfor their complete autonomous maturation .4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the onlydeterminant of its overall shape .

early experience and the socialization of cognitive modes in childrenthis paper deals with the question: what is cultural deprivation and howdoes it act to shape and depress the resources of the human mind?  thearguments presented are: first, that the behavior which leads to social,educational, and economic poverty is socialized in early childhood; second,that the central quality involved in the effects of cultural deprivation is alack of cognitive meaning in the mother-child communication system; and, third,that the growth of cognitive processes is fostered in family control systemswhich offer and permit a wide range of alternatives of action and thought andthat such growth is constricted by systems of control which offer predeterminedsolutions and few alternatives for consideration and choice.the research group was composed of 160 negro mothers and their4-year-old children selected from four different social status levels.the data are presented to show social status differences among thefour groups with respect to cognitive functioning and linguistic codes andto offer examples of relations between maternal and child behavior that arecongruent with the general lines of argument laid out.

1560. the ultrastructure of the lungs of lambs.  the relation of osmiophilicinclusions and alveolar lining layer to fetal maturation and experimentallyproduced respiratory distressthe lungs in 69 fetal and newborn lambswere studied.  osmiophilic inclusion bodiesfirst appeared at about 121 days gestationand their total number increased withmaturation.  normal surface activity oflung extracts was detectable a few daysfollowing the appearance of inclusionbodies.  the excretory nature of the type iialveolar epithelial cell, the phospholipidnature of the inclusion body content, thedecrease in the number of inclusionbodies and their loss of density associatedwith respiratory distress and with theloss of normal surface activity of lung ex-tracts provide strong evidence thatinclusion bodies are the source of pulmonarysurfactant.  a dense osmiophilic alveolarlining layer in mammals is described.since the presence of such a layer iswell correlated with surface tension valuesand the number of inclusions, it issuggested that this layer consists of surfaceactive substances.  the difficulty indetecting such an osmiophilic layer in othermammals is thought to be, at leastin part, due to species differences in the compo-sition of materials constituting thepulmonary surfactant.  cytologic immaturityexists until lamb fetuses reach 135days gestation.  this is considered to be thebasis for the susceptibility of immaturelambs to respiratory distress.  fibrin with230 a periodicity is a component,although a small one, of hyaline membranes inlambs.  in view of the fact that maturefibrin appearing as bundles of fibrils is rare-ly found, it is suggested that the bulkof the hyaline membrane is not a mature fi-brin, but probably consists of polymersof fibrinogen and serum protein.

advances in filariasisespecially concerning periodicity of microfilariaea review is given of some advances in our knowledge about filariasis during thepast ten years.it is urged that investigations should be continued on methods to facilitatethe control of filariasis in large populations, by means ofdiethylcarbamazine--e.g. incorporation of the compound in cooking salt, aswas done with chloroquine against malaria.  furthermore, steps should be takento protect young people against filariasis by systematic treatment in theschools.in order to understand the cyclical disappearance of microfilariae from theperipheral blood and their accumulation in the lungs, the movements ofmicrofilariae in the pulmonary capillaries has been studied by cinematography.apparently their accumulation in the lungs is not due to mechanical retention,but perhaps they migrate round and round in the pre-capillary network ofarterioles.the periodicity of microfilariae is best considered as a biological rhythm.apparently the microfilariae have a circadian rhythm of their own which isentrained and synchronized by stimuli from the circadian rhythm of the host.judging by experiments with monkeys containing microfilariae of edesonfilariamalayensis, the most effective of these stimuli from the host seems to be therhythmic variation of body temperature which occurs every 24 hours.

tissue distribution of electrolytes, ca and mg in experimentalhyper- and hypoparathyroidism.the effects of experimental hyper- andhypoparathyroidism on plasma and tissuedistribution of electrolytes and tissueexchangeability with ca and mg were studiedin dogs following acute renal pedicleligation.  in hyperparathyroidism, plasma concentrationsof mg and inorganic p aswell as ca were increased.  a greater accumulationof ca occurred in some tissuesand a lesser accumulation in others thanin acute hypercalcemia of comparableseverity and the fractional rate of exchangeof tissue ca was 30% more rapid thanin control and acute hypercalcemic dogs.bone exchange of ca was not significantlyincreased.  cell mg concentrations werenot appreciably altered by hyperparathyroidismexcept for a significant 9% decreasein myocardium, but the fractional rateof exchange of tissue mg was increased.acidsoluble p concentrations were decreasedin 3 tissues and na and c1 concentrationswere decreased by 10 to 25% in 4 tissues.in hypoparathyroidism, in addition to adecreased plasma ca, the incrementin plasma inorganic p that usually occursafter renal pedicle ligation was 75% lessthan in control dogs.  cell ca concentrationswere decreased by 10-40% but thefractional rate of exchange of tissue ca wasunaltered.  although cell mg concentrationswere unaltered a 40% increase occurredin the exchangeability of skeletal musclemg.  tissue na and c1 concentrations weredecreased by 20% in 2 tissues.  it has beenpreviously reported that hypercalcemiaincreases cell ca concentrations by raisingthe extracellular ca concentration gradient.evidence has also been presented thathypercalcemia directly inhibits cellinflux of mg and na and cell efflux of k.with altered parathyroid activity, 2 typesof effects are observed: those which aredependent upon an abnormal extracellularca concentration and those which appear tobe due to intrinsic effects of parathormoneon cell cation transport.  the presentdata are compatible with the hypothesesthat parathormone stimulates bidirectionaltransport of cell ca and p, stimulatescell influx of mg and opposes the effects ofhypercalcemia on cell transport of univalent ions.

further observations of the lymphomasof african childrenduring 1963, cytopathogenic, filtrable agents were frequently encountered incultures of embryonic human kidney cells following their inoculation withsupernatant fluids from primary human amnion cultures which had previously beenexposed to extracts of tumors and other specimens from east african childrenwith malignant lymphomas of the kind described by burkitt and others.  theresults seemed noteworthy because they suggested an intimate associationbetween the agents and the disease, and also because of the nature of theisolations which involved two phenomena, an initial induction of a peculiarspindling and twisting of the amnion cells(fig. 1) and subsequently destructive changesin kidney cells inoculated with fluid from such altered amnion cultures.  thedirect inoculation of embryonic kidney cells with extracts of tumors or bonemarrow never caused cytopathogenic effects nor did the isolated, transmissibleagents have the capacity to induce the amnion lesions.  nevertheless,the two effects were closely associated and clearly related to the specimens.the cytopathogenic agents were later cultivated on protein-rich media andfound to have the characteristics of mycoplasma.  they failed to inducetumors in a variety of animals, and serologic tests in which they served asantigen gave suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a relationship to thedisease.  the mycoplasma also failed to induce the amnion lesions caused bythe specimens.

growth and survival of mycoplasma neurolyticum in liquid media.maximal growth of m. neurolyticum (between10 and 10 colony-forming units/ml)was obtained after 3 days of incubationat 36 c in broth media containing 10% agamahorse serum.  when whole horse serumwas used in the medium, a complement-mediatedinhibition was observed.  thisinhibition could only be detected when growthwas followed by daily plate counts.  maximalgrowth was delayed for about 24 hr bythe horse serum, and the inhibition wasspontaneously reversed at the temperatureof incubation.  penicillin g was also foundto have a temporary inhibitory effect.this was detected with as little as 40 units/ml.maximal growth was delayed untilthe 6th day of incubation, when 200 units/mlwas present, and until the 16th day,when 1,000 units/ml was present.  thesurvival of m. neurolyticum at undetectablelevels in cultures during the incubationperiod presented an 'eclipse' phenomenonwhich has not been explained.  the recrudescenceof growth in such cultures late inthe incubation period illustrates the eventswhich may occur when mycoplasmas areisolated from clinical material by prolongedincubation in the presence of inhibitorssurvival data showed that m. neurolyticumhad greatest stability at ph 8.0, withreduced viability at ph 9.0, 7.0, 10.0, and6.0, in that order.  the data on growthand stability suggest a close relationshipbetween the species of mycoplasma studiesand bacteria.

4105. free fatty acid metabolism in chinese hamstersin normal chinese hamsters (cricetulusgriseus) the mean concentration of freefatty acids (ffa) in serum varied fromgroup to group, but was (1) consistently 4to 9 times greater than in rats, dogs,or man; (2) slightly higher than in syrianhamsters; (3) two- to four-fold higherthan in fasting or alloxan-diabetic rats.  theepididymal adipose tissue of the chinesehamster (1) had initial concentrations offfa comparable to those in the rat andsyrian hamster; (2) released, in the sametime interval, 8- to 10-fold more ffain vitro than this tissue of the rat; (3) hadhigher concentrations of ffa after incubationthan the incubated tissue of the rat.the retroperitoneal (perirenal) adipose tissueof the chinese hamster was less ac-tive in release of fatty acids in vitro than theepididymal, but was, however, moreactive than the epididymal adipose tissue ofthe rat.  these characteristics of ffametabolism in the chinese hamster wereapparently attributable to species, not toage, diet, or sex.  in the chinese hamster,the weight of the epididymal adipose tis-sue per gram of body was relatively high.it appears that in this species the rate ofrelease of fatty acids from adipose tissueis great, leading to high ffa concentra-tions in serum.  in chinese hamster and ratadipose tissues in vitro, glucose and in-sulin (separately) reduced the rate of releaseof ffa and the amount of ffa in thetissues, but glucose and insulin togetherproduced the greatest reduction.  the netreduction in ffa release by glucose andinsulin in vitro was greater in tissue fromthe chinese hamster.  insulin markedlyincreased glucose uptake by the adipose tis-sues of both species.  the possible relationof the results to spontaneous diabetes inthe chinese hamster is discussed.

specific carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system .a wide variety of human adult and fetal tissues were studied byimmunodiffusion techniques in agar gel to determine whether theycontained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in coloniccancers . in the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identicalantigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of theentodermally derived epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract andpancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues . thecommon antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specificcancer antigens of the human digestive system . system-specific cancerantigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans .experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigenswere also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6months of gestation . these components were named /carcinoembryonic/antigens of the human digestive system . on the basis of the presentfindings and the recent work regarding control of the expression ofgenetic potentialities in various genetic potentialities in varioustypes of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigensrepresent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course ofdifferentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappearin the corresponding malignant cells by a process ofderepressive-dedifferentiation .

influence of parathyroid activity on ionexchange in various tissues1. balance data from three patients with hypoparathyroidism, who weregiven parathyroid extract, are presented.  the metabolic response wascomplex.  the data demonstrate losses of phosphate, magnesium, sodiumand potassium which were not accounted for by destruction of either boneor non-osseous tissues.  preferential depletion of these minerals from bone,or loss from non-osseous tissues, must be presumed.2. the exchange of ca45, mg28, and p32 in a spectrum of rat tissues hasbeen studied in sham operated, parathyroidectomized, and parathyroidextract treated rats.  the effects of parathyroidectomy on the developmentof magnesium deficiency were determined.3. four hours after parathyroidectomy, increased transport of calciuminto bone, kidney, intestine, liver, brain, and muscle was found.  six daysafter parathyroidectomy equilibrium had been reestablished and exchangerates were identical to those in sham operated animals.4. the administration of parathyroid extract was associated with de-creased transport of ca15, mg28, and p32 into bone.  ca15 exchange in kidneywas reduced but in all other tissues exchange of ca15 and mg28 was in-creased.  p32 exchange in both intestine and kidney was mardedly increasedin animals receiving the extract.5. parathyroidectomy greatly minimized the manifestations of mag-nesium deficiency in young rats on magnesium deficient diets.6. the results suggest that parathyroid hormone may affect the trans-port and exchange of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate (and perhapssodium and potassium) in tissues other than those usually considered tobe target organs.

the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat containscharacteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures butbasically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limitingmembrane of the unit type .inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradationwhich occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . someinclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presentedsuggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involvedin the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associatedwith the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusionbodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge byaccretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolarspace . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater numberlate in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when thecuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattenedtype . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusionbodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it isconcluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active duringremodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonarysurfactant is discussed .

parathyroid extract-induced changes in the oxidation of citrate,succinate and other organic acids by liver.parathyroid extract (pte) or partiallypurified parathyroid hormone administered invivo markedly altered the oxidationin vitro by rabbit liver minces of citrate, -ketoglutarate-c, succinate-c, fumarate-cand lactate.  with ca ++ present in theincubation medium, minces from ptetreated animals produced more co and hada greater o consumption than did controlminces.  this stimulation was due, in partat least, to a more rapid decline in metabolicactivity of the control tissues.  whenca++ was absent, total metabolism wasincreased and the tissue derived from ptetreated animals was less active than thecontrol tissue.  the effect was detected asearly as 4 hr after injection (750 u/kg)and could be elicited with as little as 200 u(at 14 hr).  the action of pte could notbe duplicated by the injection of cacl intothe animal.  the data suggest that one effectof treatment was a general inhibition ofoxidation.  the stimulation of metabolismcould be a consequence of this inhibitionor a separate unrelated alteration.

the serological differentiation of mycoplasma strains (pleuro-pneumonia-like organisms) from various sourcesa complement fixation test with rabbit antisera was used to differentiate 82cultures of mycoplasma from man, mammalian cell cultures, laboratory rats andmice, cattle, goats, poultry, embryonated eggs and sewage.seventeen serotypes were distinguished, 5 from man, 1 from mammalian cellcultures, 4 from rats and mice, 4 from cattle and goats, 2 from poultry and onesaprophytic.  most of these corresponded to recognized species of mycoplasma,but 1 of human origin (represented by 1 strain, navel), and 1 from tissuecultures (5 strains), may represent new species.  r38, one of the serotypesfrom rats, could be distinguished from the species m. arthritidis, but isprobably an antigenic variant rather than a distinct species.  two specieshitherto recognized as distinct m. arthritidis and m. hominis type 2, could notbe distinguished and appear to constitute a single species.  these findingsillustrate the necessity, from the viewpoint of taxonomy, of comparingmycoplasma strains by serological methods.the serotypes of human and animal origin were largely host-specific.exceptions were the inclusion of m. arthritidis from rats and m. hominis type 2from man in a single serotype, the finding of a bovine organism among thestrains isolated from goats and of a saprophytic strain in a rat.in relation to the aetiology of disease in man and animals, the isolation ofan endogenous mycoplasma from embryonated eggs used to passage infectivematerial illustrates the importance of identifying these organismsserologically.  the demonstration of mixed mycoplasma infections in lesionsin two rats shows the necessity of adequately purifying all cultures ofmycoplasma before examination.
