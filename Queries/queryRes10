1368. immunologic competence and induction of neoplasms bypolyoma virusthymectomy at 3 days of age in severalinbred strains of mice and in an f1 hybridresulted in a strikingly increased frequencyof neoplasms following infection withpolyoma virus.  age susceptibility was extendedto at least 30 days of age in highlyresistant c57bl mice.  the usual stigmataassociated with thymectomy at birth werenot found in the 3-day thymectomized mice.nonetheless the methods used to restoreimmunologically deficient thymectomizedneonates were also effective in restoringthe capacity to resist polyoma virus tumorinduction: adult syngeneic spleen cells,thymus tissue in millipore diffusion chambersand syngeneic thymus grafts.  growthcurves of polyoma virus in kidney, salivaryglands and liver were quite similar inthymectomized and intact litter mates.hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies deter-mined periodically up to 30 days afterinfection were also similar in both groups.these results are discussed in terms ofa concept involving virus-specific 'tumor'antigens and the immunologic status of the animal.

2570. treatment of canine neoplasms with autogenous vaccinial preparationsinbred mice with transplantable sarcomaand carcinoma were treated with im-plants of their tumours which had beengrown in strains of mice normally resistantto the tumours.  complete regression oftransplantable tumours was noted in 22%of the treated mice and 78% had lifespans double that of untreated controls.one dog with spontaneous scirrhousmammary carcinoma and another withlymphosarcoma were treated with implantsof their own tumours after growth incortisone-treated mice.  regression of thespontaneous neoplasms followed in bothcases.  it is suggested that growth of aneoplasm in a foreign host alters the mole-cular structure of the neoplasm, making itantigenic when returned to the originalhost.  antigens produced are also effectiveagainst the original lesions.

266. immunology of the cancer cell: tumour-specific antigensafter a broad historical survey of immunologicalstudies of cancer, a review is givenof the evidence showing that antigens present innormal cells are missing from themalignant cells that arise from the same tissue.this evidence is considered in con-junction with the deletion hypothesis of carcinogenesis,and the author emphasizes,that in his view, the key event in carcinogenesisis enzymatic deletion.  antigenicgain and intensification in the course of spontaneous,chemical, and viral carcino-genesis is reviewed, together with experimentsdemonstrating the existence oftumour-specific antigens.  the question is thenposed: if tumours have specific anti-gens, why is evidence for their rejection so scanty?the occasional spontaneous re-gression points to host resistance but its raritysuggests that tolerance generallydevelops.  consideration is given to theapplication of immunological methods totherapy and although current achievementin this field is limited, new immunologicalstratagems might yet transform the picture.finally a plea is made for the integra-tion of the disciplines of immunology andcellular differentiation.  the prospect israised that through a synthetic and holisticapproach we might discover the suscepti-bility of the cancer cell to re-differentiationand re-recognition.

management of advanced endometrialadenocarcinoma with medroxyprogesteroneacetatea basis for progestin therapy for patientswith advanced endometrial adenocarcinomais presented.  the criteria for selection ofpatients for hormone therapy and the sched-ule of administration of medroxyprogester-one (provera) is discussed.  evaluation ofpatients for objective changes only, i.e., byvisual, palpable, histologic, or roentgeno-logic means, revealed complete or partialremission with significant palliation in 8 of20 patients (40 per cent).  response to me-droxyprogesterone therapy is apparently re-lated to degree of differentiation of the pri-mary neoplasm, the well-differentiated le-sions being more responsive.  documentationof tumor effect by serial biopsies duringtreatment provides an index to the histologicchanges this progestin produces in suscep-tible cases.  the effects of therapy uponserial urinary hormone excretion rates isdocumented in several patients.on the basis of our experience, the treat-ment of patients with advanced endometrialadenocarcinoma with the potent progestinmedroxyprogesterone seems justified.

7364. experimental amyloidosis in immunitymuch of interest in the mechanism ofexperimental amyloidosis as a result of theparenteral introduction of foreign proteinhas been centered around the nature ofthe links leading to cytological and biochemicalchanges in tissues and body fluids.some of the authors suggested that such linksmay be of immunological nature.there is however, no clear-cut proof eitherin favor of or against the theory of animmunological origin of amyloid.  sinceinjection of proteins during the perinatalperiod prevents an immune response whenthe animal is subsequently challengedwith the same antigen, the authors studiedamyloidosis caused by casein in micetreated after birth with this protein.  miceexposed soon after birth to casein ac-quire an immune tolerance to this antigen.this was demonstrated by the absenceof circulating antibodies as measured by thedisappearance of i-labeled caseinfrom the circulation and by means of passivehemagglutination tests with asciticfluids.  both tolerant and control animalsdeveloped amyloidosis to the same extent.the results imply that the pathogenesis ofamyloidosis does not rest upon a classicimmunological basis; they do not excludethe possibility, that the disease may bedue to some auto-immune process.

effects of parathyroid hormone and other proteins in vitroon mitochondrial metabolismit is apparent that in addition to parathyroid hormone, severalnon-hormonal basic proteins stimulate mitochondrial respiration, iontransport, and atpase, but inhibit the 32pi-atp exchange reaction.thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biologicalactions of parathyroid hormone as the previous reports suggested.rasmussen et al. (1964) have also isolated from parathyroidextracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrialtransport of phosphate in vitro.  they postulated that this proteinmight be yet another biologically important factor produced by para-thyroid glands.  the latter speculation may not be warranted in viewof the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria.  allof our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroidproteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically,or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone.further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determinewhether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validlyreflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is soundto use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.

the pathology of 'giant cell hepatitis' in early infancy.a 1-month-old male infant was admitted tohospital because of acute cardiac andcirculatory failure.  autopsy revealed macronodularliver cirrhosis with splenomegaly,left ventricular dilatation of the heart,hydrothorax, and ascites.  histologyof the liver showed a giant cell hepatitis.  theportal areas were widened, with fociof erythropoiesis and histiocytic infiltrations.the liver cells showed vacuolar anddegenerative changes.  the giant cells, presentin the margin of the regenerationareas, as well as in the degenerated lobuleshas irregular borders and varied insize from 45-60 ft.  their nuclei were large,sometimes bizarre.  their basophilecytoplasm showed granules of iron pigmentwhich was also found in some normalhepatic cells, in the prominent kupffer cellsand in the connective tissue.  in thespleen there were proliferation of connectivetissue and scattered areas of erythropoiesis,as well as pigment deposits in the pulpa.iron pigment was also found in thepancreas and salivary glands.  the islets oflangerhans were hyperplastic.  the etiologyof giant cell hepatitis is still unknown.its pathogenesis may be due to a malformation,immunologic response to some typeof antibody, inborn errors of ironmetabolism and viral infection.  it is suggestedthat the giant cell transformation isa response of the immature liver cell to a varietyof stimuli.  this case is of interestfor the predominance of giant cells with 1 or2 nuclei, presumably it is an intermediatestage or a variant of hepatitis.

immunological demonstration of factor viii protein in the plasma ofhemophiliacs and its value for an insight into hemophilia a.by immunization of rabbits one obtains antiseraagainst human factor viii, the actionof the immunsera has been determined usinga modification of the thromboplastingenerationstest (the factor viii neutralizationtest).  the antibodies against factor viiiare equally absorbed by either normal or hemophiliaa plasma.  this observation showsthat hemophilia a plasma contains as much factorviii protein as normal plasma does.in normal and hemophilia a serum one findsat a lower level similar concentrations offactor viii.  in analogy with cross-reacting substances(crm) in bacteria mutants anhypothesis has been made according to whichthe authors are dealing with the productof a genetically altered synthesis of factor viii.this product is functionally less activebut possesses the same antigenic determinantsas the normal factor viii.  some inhibitorproperties of the hemophilia plasma can beexplained by competitive inhibition madepossible by the similarity of structure.  the factthat the inhibitor discovered by mammenand factor viii have similar properties supportthe hypothesis.  the theory of someauthors according to which the plasma of anhemophiliac a contains normal amountsof a normal factor viii blocked by a specificinhibitor, the pathogenetic agent of hemophilia ais rejected because of genetic considerationsand because the accelerator appearingafter ether treatment of hemophilia a plasma isnot identical with factor viii.

1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renalhomotransplantationdammin g. j.a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs hasbeen completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants.over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed.increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questionsregarding the status treated host.  the current drug protocol of azathioprineand diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50%100-day survivors.  the following observations have been documented  allanimals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapycan be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneysapparently are protected in some way in the new environment because asecond donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantationof a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decreasein renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted backto their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party,non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for theprolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a doubledose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption ormetabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results becausetwo kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in thesame drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient andthis sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned fromdrugs.  additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidneyhomografts reveal the following  skin homografts are universally rejectedwithin 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidneyhomografts sometimes permanently.  when skin and kidney homografts from thesame donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidneysurvival is shortened.  this paradoxical effect probably is explained by theproduction of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney.additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female,are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalizedimmunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.

the immunological development of the humanfetusthe normal human fetus is said not to be engaged in the formation of immuno-globulins; the immunoglobulins present in the serum of the fetus and thenewborn are considered to be of maternal origin.  in favor of this opinion isthe observation that directly after birth the serum of the newborn contains anappreciable amount of igg, with gm groups identical with those of the mother(68-70).  the level of the igg of the neonate decreases gradually during thefirst 3 months (3,27,71), which is generally explained by the catabolism ofthe maternal igg, whereas the formation by the newborn infant is stillinadequate to maintain the original level (16,27).  the best evidence for thetransplacental passage is the almost complete absence of igg in the serum ofnewborn infants from mothers with agammaglobulinemia (3,27).the transfer of the immunoglobulins appears to be a selective process(13, 15).  while igg is readily transferred, there is little, if any,transfer of iga and igm, as has been shown by ultracentrifugation andimmunoelectrophoretic studies of the serum (12, 16, 19, 20) and the analysisof maternally-transferred antibodies (31-33).  with more sensitive techniquessuch as the double diffusion test in agar or quantitative immunochemicaltechniques, however, minute amounts of both igm and iga have been detectedin fetal blood as well as in cord blood from mature and immature neonates(12, 19, 20, 23, 26).  since large molecules do not pass the placenta, thismay indicate that the trace amounts of igm originate in the fetus itself, buttransplacental passage has not been completely excluded.the absence of immunoglobulin formation has been associated with the absenceof plasma cells in the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow of the normal humanfetus and the newborn.  it has been reported that these cells do not appearuntil a few weeks after birth (2, 3, 14, 25, 34).  however, in pathologicalconditions such as congenital syphilis and toxoplasmosis the human fetus hasbeen found to respond to the antigenic stimulus with intrauterine formation ofplasma cells after about the sixth month of gestation (24,25).

1770. proliferative activity of thelymphatic tissues of rats asstudied with tritium-labelledthymidinecytokinetic data are presented, employingquantitation of h3dna in the lymphatictissues of normal rats serially sacrificedafter h3tdr administration.  a markeddifference in the patterns of initial labelingand label loss was observed between thethymus and peripheral lymphatic tissue.the data are compatible with other indica-tions of rapid cell renewal in the thymus.there is suppression of initial uptake ofh3tdr into the dna of each large lymphocyticprogenitor cell in the thymus, appa-rently because of a feedback of thymidinecontaining material from small lympho-cytes in the thymus.  depletion of the thymusof small cells, as by operative stressor whole body x-ray, leads to a markedincrease in the uptake of h3tdr into thedna of large thymocytes.  this finding,which is in agreement with the previousfindings of sugino et al. suggesting transferof thymine nucleotides from small thy-mus lymphocytes to precursor cells, may ormay not be related to the apparenttransfer of dna label between thymic cells.the evidence for the latter consists ofthe curvilinear dilution of the dna label inthe thymus proliferating cell populationand the relationship between the rate of dnalabel dilution in large cells and thedna in the small cells in the thymus.  afterthe dna label in progenitor cells inthe thymus and lymph nodes has entered thesmall cell population, the subsequentdilution of grains in these dividing cells followsthe same slope as the loss of radio-activity from the entire lymph node.  there is along retention of some h3dna labelin the dividing lymph node cell population.  thissuggests that the loss of radioacti-vity from the dividing cells and from the smallcell population as a whole occurs e-qually.  this pattern prevails regardless ofwhether the percentage of large andsmall cells is altered experimentally.  thesefindings can be explained by an inter-change of the dna nuclear label between smalllymphocytes and large lymphocytes.this could occur by some process such asphagocytosis or pinocytosis, or by trans-formation of the small lymphocyte into a large,dividing cell.  the data fit best withthe latter possibility.  all or any of thesemechanisms would lead to an equilibrationof the dna label between large and smallcells.  this finding prevents the assign-ment of a finite life span to lymphocytes onthe basis of dna labeling kinetics.  ne-vertheless, there appear to be at least twodifferent types of lymphocytes.  one,the 'thymus-type' lymphocyte, is found in thethymus cortex, bone marrow and ger-minal centers of lymphoid follicles.  the othertype, found abundantly in the wide-spread peripheral lymphatic tissue, shows avery prolonged retention of dna la-bel and is believed to be recirculating,'immunologically committed' cells describedby others.  these cells do not appear toenter the thymus cortex.
