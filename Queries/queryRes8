drugs and neonatal jaundice .this paper is not intended as an exhaustive review of bilirubinmetabolism nor of the many factors which may result in exaggeratedphysiologic jaundice.. for such a review the interested reader isreferred to the excellent articles by zuelzer and brown . brief mentionhas been made of the mechanism by which certain drugs may contribute tothe development of hyperbilirubinemia . a few drugs, the water-solublevitamin k derivatives, sulfasoxazole (gantrisin), the salicylates, andnovobiocin have been unequivocally shown to affect adversely the newborninfant's ability to handle bilirubin . in time other compounds willdefinitely be incriminated .it is important to remember that the administration of a drug to amother just prior to delivery may result in appreciable concentrationsof the compound in the infant's serum, and that drugs administered tothe nursing mother may be excreted in breast milk and thereby absorbedby the infant . careful consideration of the drugs given not only to thenewborn but also to the mother is therefore essential if we are to avoidwhat may be termed iatrogenic hyperbilirubinemia .

2701. the role of certain additional factors in the development of amyloidosis,and its prophylaxis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)in patients with chronic fibrocavernoustuberculosis of the lungs, any toxic-aller-gic side reactions to antibacterial therapy,chronic foci or infection and diseaseswith an allergic component can contributeto the development of amyloidosis.  theearly detection and clearing of chronicfoci of infection and effective measuresagainst even mildly pronounced toxic-allergicside reactions are of prime impor-tance in the prevention of amyloidosis.  theunsystematic and prolonged administra-tion of antibacterial preparations, along withtheir toxic side effects, tends to in-crease the incidence of amyloidosis in patientswith chronic fibrocavernous pulmon-ary tb.  individual constitutional factors areof great importance in the developmentof side effects.  side reactions to chemopreparations,in cases of hypofunction ofthe liver and kidneys and autonomicdysfunction promote the development of dys-trophic processes, as is confirmedby the high frequency of toxic-allergic reac-tions in patients with fibrocavernouspulmonary tb who later develop amyloidosis.the administration of desensitizing drugsto patients showing side reactions there-fore helps to prevent amyloidosis in casesof chronic fibrocavernous tb, and chemo-therapy should be automatically combinedwith the administration of desensitizingand stimulatory drugs in this class of case.

1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renalhomotransplantationdammin g. j.a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs hasbeen completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants.over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed.increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questionsregarding the status treated host.  the current drug protocol of azathioprineand diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50%100-day survivors.  the following observations have been documented  allanimals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapycan be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneysapparently are protected in some way in the new environment because asecond donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantationof a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decreasein renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted backto their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party,non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for theprolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a doubledose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption ormetabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results becausetwo kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in thesame drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient andthis sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned fromdrugs.  additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidneyhomografts reveal the following  skin homografts are universally rejectedwithin 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidneyhomografts sometimes permanently.  when skin and kidney homografts from thesame donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidneysurvival is shortened.  this paradoxical effect probably is explained by theproduction of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney.additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female,are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalizedimmunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.

epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) as a therapeutic agent based on 5years clinical experience.experience in the treatment of 744 patients withe-aca suggested that the use of the preparation is indicatedin the following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhagein association with delivery.  (2) acute systemicfibrinolysis in association with surgery.  it ismainly major operations on the thorax, pancreas, prostate,liver and genital organs that are complicated byfibrinolysis, but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur afterany operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis in patientswith cancer, particularly cancer of the prostateand pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicatingvarious disorders, especially leukaemia, livercirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote inthrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activityin the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduceblood losses following prostatectomy, especially if thetreatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopicallyclear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumaticinjury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia andother coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effectivewhether given orally or intravenously.  in stateswith increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity inthe urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day hasproved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug one.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function testswere observed, not even in cases receiving more than1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs ofintravascular coagulation in connection with e-acatherapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications after prostatectomy in patientstreated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.judging from the authors' experience in this materiale-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.

long-term prognosis and the response of schizophrenic childrento drug therapy: a controlled study of trifluoperazine.it is evident from this study that treatment andcontrol groups must be matched for severity of illness,since this affects the responsiveness to pharmacologicalas well as to other types of treatments.  the use ofthe double-blind technique does not of itself guaranteea well-controlled study; the comparison of 2 or moretreatment regimes may be misleading if the groups arenot matched, or if the matching is not based on criticalfactors.  in this study, both the response to the nonpharmacologicaspects of treatment and the type ofresponse to the drug itself were related to the initialseverity of language impairment.  thus the major developmentaldefect which determines long-term outcomefor schizophrenic children in this group also predictedthe immediate responsiveness to treatment.  within the2 major prognostic subgroups of young schizophrenicchildren, those with speech and those without, are childrenwith different profiles of disordered developmentand different patterns of assets and handicaps.

the action of oral diureticsin diabetes insipiduschronic administration of chlorothiazide andother thiazide analogues in diabetes insipidusresults in a striking reduction in urinary volumewith increase in urinary osmolality.  this curiousantidiuretic action was first described bycrawford & kennedy (1959), and though it hassince been widely confirmed in both the pituitaryand nephrogenic forms of the disease, its precisemechanism remains obscure.  a number ofinvestigators have sought to explain the phenom-enon entirely on the basis of the renal actions ofthese drugs (earley & orloff 1962, goodman &carter 1962), whilst others have contended thatabatement of polyuria may be secondary to acentral effect of the thiazides in decreasing thirst(robson & lambie 1962, skadhauge 1963).over the past two years, we have conducteddetailed in-patient studies of the action ofvarious diuretic drugs of the thiazide and otherseries in a group of 7 patients with pituitarydiabetes insipidus.

nephrogenic diabetes insipiduschlorothiazide has been found of value inestablishing and maintaining adequate hydra-tion in some patients; its exact mechanism ofaction is not known.  the antidiuretic effectsof chlorothiazide and its analogues have beenstudied in six patients with ndi, two ofwhom were infants less than six months ofage.  dehydrated infants showed a dramaticresponse to treatment.  with those unable toachieve an optimal fluid intake prior to treat-ment, the initial beneficial response was asso-ciated with an increased fluid intake.  follow-ing this initial antidiuretic response, a vari-able degree of "escape" or resistance to theaction of the drug commonly occurred.  de-spite the unpredictability of a prolonged anti-diuretic response, a therapeutic trial of chloro-thiazide in ndi seems warranted if diet aloneis not sufficient to maintain hydration.  it mustbe remembered, however, that this drug is po-tentially toxic.

effects of parathyroid hormone and other proteins in vitroon mitochondrial metabolismit is apparent that in addition to parathyroid hormone, severalnon-hormonal basic proteins stimulate mitochondrial respiration, iontransport, and atpase, but inhibit the 32pi-atp exchange reaction.thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biologicalactions of parathyroid hormone as the previous reports suggested.rasmussen et al. (1964) have also isolated from parathyroidextracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrialtransport of phosphate in vitro.  they postulated that this proteinmight be yet another biologically important factor produced by para-thyroid glands.  the latter speculation may not be warranted in viewof the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria.  allof our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroidproteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically,or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone.further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determinewhether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validlyreflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is soundto use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.

the role of aldosterone and vasopressin in the posturalchanges in renal excretion in normal subjectsand patients with idiopathic edemathe effects of the upright posture(leisurely walking for 2 hours) on half-hourly urine volume, and excretion ofsodium and creatinine were studied in13 normal subjects and 13 patients withidiopathic edema, while they drank 150or 300 ml. of 0.14 per cent sodiumchloride solution every half hour.  whenthe 2 hours of walking were comparedwith a preceding recumbent period of4 hours, both groups were found to showa significant antidiuresis upright.  theadministration of ethanol during the lasthalf hour of recumbency abolished thefall in urine flow and in free water clear-ance during the first hour of walking inthe normal subjects and significantly re-duced this fall in the patients withedema.  sodium excretion in the normalsubjects was slightly but not significantlylower when upright than when recum-bent, but in the edematous patients wassignificantly lower when upright and fellprogressively over the 2 hour period.  ad-ministration of spironolactone or d-amphetamine increased sodium excretionduring recumbency in both groups butincreased sodium excretion upright onlyin the edematous patients to equal thatof the normal subjects.  creatinine excre-tion was not changed in either group byposture or drug therapy.  similar studieswere performed on 5 patients with un-treated diabetes insipidus and on 6 pa-tients with adrenal insufficiency treatedwith hydrocortisone alone.  lack of al-dosterone (in adrenal insufficiency) didnot increase the amount of sodium ex-creted above that of normal subjects inrecumbency and did not prevent the oc-currence of significant sodium retentionin the upright posture.  however, lackof adh (in diabetes insipidus) delayedthe antidiuresis upright for 30 minutes.the results indicate that adh releaseis probably responsible for the reductionin urine volume during the first 30 min-utes after assuming the upright posture,but not thereafter.  the excessive magni-tude of the orthostatic antidiuresis inidiopathic edema probably results froma cause other than adh release, since itis not completely overcome by ethanol.reduced na excretion during 2 hours inthe upright posture can occur in theabsence of circulating aldosterone, butthe abnormal magnitude of the na re-tention in the patients with idiopathicedema probably results from hyperal-dosteronism.

cancer chemotherapy by prolonged arterialinfusionour current experience is reported with136 patients treated by prolonged arterialinfusion chemotherapy.  the patients pre-sented a variety of far advanced cancers un-suitable for conventional surgical or roent-gen therapy.  antimetabolite solution, eithermethotrexate or a fluorinated pyrimidine,was injected continuously through a smallplastic catheter into the unobstructed arteryto provide a high regional drug concentrationfor days to weeks.  the patients have receiveddrug infusion for up to 45 days.  their coursehas been followed for up to 37 months aftertreatment.methotrexate with antidote therapy bysystemic administration of citrovorum fac-tor was used preferentially in most patients.a fluorinated pyrimidine, most commonly,5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, was preferred forhepatic artery infusion of liver metastases.

tissue distribution of electrolytes, ca and mg in experimentalhyper- and hypoparathyroidism.the effects of experimental hyper- andhypoparathyroidism on plasma and tissuedistribution of electrolytes and tissueexchangeability with ca and mg were studiedin dogs following acute renal pedicleligation.  in hyperparathyroidism, plasma concentrationsof mg and inorganic p aswell as ca were increased.  a greater accumulationof ca occurred in some tissuesand a lesser accumulation in others thanin acute hypercalcemia of comparableseverity and the fractional rate of exchangeof tissue ca was 30% more rapid thanin control and acute hypercalcemic dogs.bone exchange of ca was not significantlyincreased.  cell mg concentrations werenot appreciably altered by hyperparathyroidismexcept for a significant 9% decreasein myocardium, but the fractional rateof exchange of tissue mg was increased.acidsoluble p concentrations were decreasedin 3 tissues and na and c1 concentrationswere decreased by 10 to 25% in 4 tissues.in hypoparathyroidism, in addition to adecreased plasma ca, the incrementin plasma inorganic p that usually occursafter renal pedicle ligation was 75% lessthan in control dogs.  cell ca concentrationswere decreased by 10-40% but thefractional rate of exchange of tissue ca wasunaltered.  although cell mg concentrationswere unaltered a 40% increase occurredin the exchangeability of skeletal musclemg.  tissue na and c1 concentrations weredecreased by 20% in 2 tissues.  it has beenpreviously reported that hypercalcemiaincreases cell ca concentrations by raisingthe extracellular ca concentration gradient.evidence has also been presented thathypercalcemia directly inhibits cellinflux of mg and na and cell efflux of k.with altered parathyroid activity, 2 typesof effects are observed: those which aredependent upon an abnormal extracellularca concentration and those which appear tobe due to intrinsic effects of parathormoneon cell cation transport.  the presentdata are compatible with the hypothesesthat parathormone stimulates bidirectionaltransport of cell ca and p, stimulatescell influx of mg and opposes the effects ofhypercalcemia on cell transport of univalent ions.

the antidiuretic effect of angiotensin in diabetes insipidus.the effect of angiotensin (val-5-hypertensinii-asp- -amide)was studied in 2 children with diabetesinsipidus (a 9 yr old boy with diabetes insipidus neuro-hormonalisand a 4 yr old girl with diabetes insipidusrenalis) in whom the clearances of inulin, pah, na andurea and the osmolar and free-water clearances wereexamined.  angiotensin produces a prompt antidiuresiswhich is combined with a gross decrease of the na-clearance.the osmolality of the urine is increased only slightlyand the free-water clearance does not become negative,both effects being contrary to those seen with vasopressin.the antidiuresis and antinatriuresis can be producedin salt-loaded and salt-deprived states.  furosemidereverses the effects of angiotensin.  the clearance ofurea is not changed by angiotensin as long as the glomerularfiltration rate remains normal.

2476. studies on cardiac dimensions in intact,unanesthetized man. i. description of techniques and theirvalidation. ii. effects of respiration. iii. effects ofmuscular exercisea method is described which permitsmeasurement of relative changes in the exter-nal dimensions of individual cardiacchambers throughout the cardiac cycle in intact,unanaesthetized man.  it consists ofsuturing multiple radiopaque silver-tantalumclips to the surface of the heart at thetime of cardiac operations.  in the postopera-tive period, cineradiograms areobtained and the distances between clips are mea-sured on each individual frame.this technique has been found to be safe and hasbeen employed in 68 patients withoutany complications.  as a result of studies in 8patients utilizing biplane serial exposures,the effects of rotation of the heart in thesagittal plane during the cardiac andrespiratory cycles were determined precisely.if clips were properly placed on the heart,the possible errors resulting from suchrotation were found to be quite small.during inspiration right ventricular dimen-sions increased, while the opposite occurredduring expiration and during the val-salva manoeuvre.  left ventricular dimensionsexhibited little change during normalrespiration.  during deep, slow inspiration,the changes in dimensions of the leftventricle lagged behind those of the rightventricle by 1 to 5 (generally 2 or 3) car-diac cycles; the magnitude of the changes inthe dimensions of the left ventricle wassmaller than that which occurred in the rightventricle.  the effects on ventriculardimensions of light muscular exercise performedin the supine position were studiedin 9 patients.  the end-diastolic dimensionsdecreased by an average of 6.0% of con-trol in the right ventricle, and by an average of5.1% in the left ventricle.  end-sys-tolic dimensions decreased by an average of 5.6%of control in the right ventricleand by an average of 6.5% in the left ventricle.these decreases are considered toapproximate one-half of the resting stroke volume.in the 4 patients in whom therate of right ventricular pressure rise was determinedcontinuously, exercise re-sulted in an elevation of dp/dt while ventricularend-diastolic dimensions decreased.these data are interpreted to indicate that anincrease in myocardial contractilityoccurs during muscular exercise in man.

resistance to human growth hormone in pituitary dwarfism:clinical and immunologic studiesthirteen pituitary dwarfs havebeen treated with human growth hormone(hgh), and growth acceleration with doses of5-7 mg/week has been observed in all but onepatient.  on therapy, this 7 1/2-year-old girl grewat a rate of 1.05 cm/month for 7 months.thereafter, despite larger doses of growthhormone (15 mg/week), growth rate fell to0.27 cm/month.  this rate of growth persistedafter stopping hgh.  on retreatment on 2occasions, acceleration of growth did notoccur.  antibodies to hgh, absent in herserum before treatment, were repeatedlydemonstrated in her serum in high concentra-tion (hgh binding capacity up to 100 mg/1)during treatment.  comparable titers of anti-body have not been found in any of the 12other patients receiving long-term hgh treat-ment.  the specificity of the human anti-hghserum differed from rabbit anti-hgh serum.whereas both monkey growth hormone(mgh) and hgh were effective inhibitors ofthe binding of hgh-131i by rabbit antiserum,only hgh was an effective inhibitor withhuman antiserum.  in like manner, a crudeplacental extract which was an effective in-hibitor for rabbit antiserum was ineffectivewith human anti-hgh serum.

(ca. 3 mg./kg.) of the drug,given by self-injection ampoules.  injections madewith the automatic ampoule autule caused no localirritation.  certain facial symptoms reported can forthe time being be regarded as resorptive side-effectsof toxogonin.  maximum blood levels of 6 ug./ml.were recorded within 20 minutes.  even after fourhours the level was still 1-2 ug./ml., a concentra-tion amply sufficient to ensure reactivation of bloodesterases.  of the injected dose, 52% was excretedin the urine after two hours, 87% after eight hours.toxogonin appears to pass through the body un-changed.

the antidiuretic mechanism of hydrochlorothia-zide in the treatment of diabetes insipidusthe changes in water and electro-lyte balance during hydrochlorothiazidetherapy in 2 patients with vasopressin-deficient diabetes insipidus were studi-ed.  in 1 case, under fixed daily so-dium intake, the urinary sodium excre-tion markedly increased on the first dayof treatment, but the urinary volumebegan to fall on the second day and per-sisted low for 3 days after discontinua-tion of the drug.  in the other case theurinary volume markedly decreasedwhen the daily sodium intake was strict-ly limited.  it further decreased onhydrochlorothiazide therapy but aftersodium intake was restored it returnedto the pretreatment level despite con-tinued use of the drug.the antidiuretic action of hydro-chlorothiazide in the treatment of dia-betes insipidus is believed to be relatedto the sodium depletion state of the bodybrought about by increased output ordecreased intake of sodium.  sodiumand water reabsorption in the proximalconvoluted tubules in the kidney in-creases and the amount of glomerularfiltrate reaching the distal convolutedtubules decreases.  thus the finalurinary volume falls.

1835. the decrease of the steroids in the urine in the course of lung tb.(the therapeutic value of their increase after calciferol)quantitative determination of the urinarysteroids in 38 patients with extensive ul-cero-caseous pulmonary tb confirmedthat the 17-ketosteroids are always decreasedin these cases.  calciferol, in the formof one ampoule of vit.  d2 of 600,000 u.every 10 days, in combination with activetuberculostatic drugs, in the majority ofthe cases leads to an increase of theurinary 17-ketosteroids from 50 to 100% in 2mth.  it appears that the calciferolexerts its action through proteolysis; it stimulatesthe liquefaction and evacuation of thecaseous material.  this proteolytic effect isrelated to that of the mineralocorticoids,which are phlogistic and proteolytic sub-stances.  calciferol offers the advantageover these substances that it does not affectthe electrolytes and is well tolerated bythe organism.  for this reason, good resultsmay be expected from its administrationin cases of extensive pulmonary tb, inwhich the myc. tuberculosis has remainedsensitive to the administered tuberculosticdrugs but nevertheless does not proceedtowards recovery because of the marked caseouslesions.  in such cases calciferol treatmentleads to a rapid and pronounced decreaseof the radiological shadows, improves thegeneral condition and also modifies thesteroid metabolism rendered abnormal by the disease.

clinical features of the alalies (russian).the term 'alalies' is applied to the variousstates of absence or insufficient developmentof speech in children, resultingfrom defective development or affectionsof the speech centers before the developmentof speech.  from the clinicalstudy it is possible to distinguish between severalforms: motor, sensory, andsemantic alaly with signs of amnesia.  thecauses are multiple: trauma, perinatalcerebral hemorrhage, inflammatory processes,metabolic disorders before thedevelopment of speech, and alimentary andtrophic disorders.  the alalies showvarying degrees of severity.  in most childrensuffering from alaly, neurologicalsigns can be demonstrated on the right side,an indication of the organic nature ofthe condition.  the presence of local symptomsin the various forms of alaly isoften associated with signs indicating involvementof adjacent regions of the cerebralhemispheres in the pathological processwhich would explain why the alaliesare often complex.  the character of the alaliesdepends on functional disordersresulting from the lesion in the frontal, anterior,motor, temporal or parietalregion of the dominant cerebral hemisphere.patients with alaly often show neuroticreactions, resulting from the disordersof the processes of inhibition and excitationof the cerebral cortex and the subcorticalformations.  early treatment ofthe alalies with drugs combined with logopedicand pedagogic measures gives good results.

198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note ofcautionazathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classifiedas 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects ofazathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because ofthe concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during theadministration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolongedsteroid therapy.  in 1 patient, the administration of azathioprine wasassociated with amelioration of an arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum which didnot respond to the use of steroids and other medication.  immuno-suppressiveobservations were limited.  the established delayed hypersensitivity response,as reflected in various skin tests, was unchanged during the administration ofazathioprine.  azathioprine had no discernible toxic effects upon the kidneysor the liver in 2 patients, 1 with postnecrotic cirrhosis and the other withserum hepatitis.  gastro-intestinal symptoms (anorexia, epigastric discomfort,and nausea) occurred in 8 patients.  mild to moderate leukopenia developed in 8patients and, in 2 individuals, was accompanied by thrombocytopenia.  temporaryalopecia occurred in 1 woman.  the hematopoietic effects developed within 2 or3 wk of therapy with azathioprine at a dosage level of 4-6 mg/kg/day.azathioprine does not exert the rapid beneficial effect in ulcerative colitisnoted with corticotropin and adrenal corticosteroids.  therefore, its use insevere ulcerative colitis requiring intensive therapy probably is undesirable.azathioprine, on the basis of these initial observations, may be considered formoderately severe ulcerative colitis, under circumstances permitting controlledand prolonged therapeutic trial as adjunct medication, but with carefulsupervision for prevention of toxicity, especially leukopenia.

further observations of the lymphomasof african childrenduring 1963, cytopathogenic, filtrable agents were frequently encountered incultures of embryonic human kidney cells following their inoculation withsupernatant fluids from primary human amnion cultures which had previously beenexposed to extracts of tumors and other specimens from east african childrenwith malignant lymphomas of the kind described by burkitt and others.  theresults seemed noteworthy because they suggested an intimate associationbetween the agents and the disease, and also because of the nature of theisolations which involved two phenomena, an initial induction of a peculiarspindling and twisting of the amnion cells(fig. 1) and subsequently destructive changesin kidney cells inoculated with fluid from such altered amnion cultures.  thedirect inoculation of embryonic kidney cells with extracts of tumors or bonemarrow never caused cytopathogenic effects nor did the isolated, transmissibleagents have the capacity to induce the amnion lesions.  nevertheless,the two effects were closely associated and clearly related to the specimens.the cytopathogenic agents were later cultivated on protein-rich media andfound to have the characteristics of mycoplasma.  they failed to inducetumors in a variety of animals, and serologic tests in which they served asantigen gave suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a relationship to thedisease.  the mycoplasma also failed to induce the amnion lesions caused bythe specimens.

effects of adrenalectomy onthe parathyroids in nephrectomized ratsrat parathyroids were studied both after nephrectomy and after com-bined nephrectomy and adrenalectomy.  as early as 24 hours afternephrectomy there were morphological indications of increased para-thyroid activity in the form of increased glandular volume and enlargedcell nuclei.  the corresponding changes after combined nephrectomy andadrenalectomy were less marked and the total serum calcium was higherthan after nephrectomy only.  these observations suggest that the adrenalscould induce a change in calcium homeostasis opposite to that of theparathyroids.

intra-arterial infusion emphasizing treatment of malignant neoplasms.this review of the english medical literaturesummarizes most of the significantpapers concerned with intra-arterial infusion.this technique of cancer therapy iseffective for palliation of many advanced primaryand recurrent cancer patients.head and neck cancer patients form the largestgroup of patients that have been treatedbecause of the easily accessible arteries.however, almost any involved organcan be infused by external approaches to thefemoral, brachial and common carotids.most oncolytic chemotherapeutic agents canbe given via the intra-arterial route atnotably increased dosages with the exceptionof 5fudr.  partial and complete regressionof many tumors can be obtained withpresent day chemotherapeutic agentsfor 1 or 2 mth.  the best therapeutic resultshave been in patients with head and neckand pelvic tumors.  currently infusion techniquesusing small mobile pumping unitspermit the patient to be ambulatory during courseof anti-tumor therapy.  complicationsfrom intra-arterial infusion are usuallyminor but serious complications dooccur such as embolic phenomena to the cnswith internal carotid infusion; aplasticbone marrow from drug toxicity, hemorrhagefrom tumor degeneration.  technicalcomplications of the infusion may not be lifethreatening but frequently prematurelyterminate the therapy.  continued interest inthis form of therapy appears inevitable.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero andin vitro with rubella virus.a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomeswas undertaken to determine if damageto the genetic apparatus of human cells maybe induced by rubella virus and whethersuch damage produces the pathology seenin newborns from mothers infected earlyin pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains wereinitiated in vitro from embryonic materialobtained by therapeutic abortion of fetusesfrom rubella-infected mothers.  embryonicmaterial from spontaneous and non-rubellatherapeutic abortions yielded similarcell strains for infection in vitro.  theresults from both types of studies were asfollows: (a) virus shedding cell strains wereobtained from all types of organs cultivated,which indicated wide disseminationof virus in the fetuses from rubella-infectedmothers.  (b) chronic infection couldreadily be established by in vitro infectionand no cytopathic effect was noted.(c) although many strains continued to shedvirus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,no changes in growth propertiesoccurred with the exception that infectedstrains from lung tissue showed limitedgrowth capacities.  (d) from observationsof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obviouschromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctionalchanges were observed instrains infected naturally or experimentally.(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derivedcell strains there was a marked elevationin frequency of chromosome breakage in3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlationbetween virus shedding in vitro andincreased chromosome breakage was notedalthough this was not complete.  (g) thecombined average frequency of chromosomebreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortionstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortusstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,but significant elevation in average chromosomebreak frequency (9.8%) was obtainedin four cell strains which had been experimentallyinfected in vitro with rubella virus(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effectsupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,these were restricted to slight general elevationsin frequency of breakage abovenormal values.  very high increases in breakswere sporadic.  it appears more likelythat the general fetal abnormalities associatedwith rubella infection in vivo resultfrom possible effects of the virus upon growthrather than from effects upon thechromosomes.  however, the studies wererestricted to fibroblasts cultured invitro; and effects on other types of cellsmay have greater implications for thisquestion.

parathyroid function in chronic renal failure.  a statistical surveyof the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy.a collection has been made of 134 personal andpublished cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in whichadequate information was available concerning thepathological state of the bones.  measurements wereavailable of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, andblood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonateand plasma proteins in a representative sample.the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the wholeseries of 134 cases were not related reciprocally butwere correlated directly.  these data were further analyzedby allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups,according to the type of pathological lesions present inthe bones.  in one group there was evidence of defectivemineralization of skeletal tissues, in the form of eitherrickets or osteomalacia, and the plasma-calcium wasfound to be statistically sub-normal.  in the other groupthere was no primary defect of mineralization but thelesions of generalized osteitis fibrosa were present andthe plasma calcium was statistically normal.  there wasno significant correlation between the plasma levels ofcalcium and phosphate in either sub-group; and the plasmaphosphate was significantly higher in the group withthe higher plasma calcium levels.  the data indicate thatin patients with renal osteodystrophy, contrary to generalbelief, the plasma calcium varies independently of theplasma phosphate.  since these results imply differencesin parathyroid function among patients with azotemicosteodystrophy, a survey has also been made ofthe recorded parathyroid weights in chronic renal failure.generalized osteitis fibrosa and the accompanying normallevels of plasma calcium are associated with greaterparathyroid hypertrophy than is found in most casesof chronic renal failure or cases with defective mineralization.the various data are interpreted in relationto the known metabolic disturbances and natural historyof azotemic osteodystrophy.  by analogy with states ofsimple vitamin d deficiency, it is suggested that hypocalcemiaand relative unresponsiveness to the calcemicaction of parathyroid hormone are related to an acquiredresistance to vitamin d.  the group of cases with statisticallynormal plasma-calcium prove that the parathyroidglands can function effectively in some patientswith chronic renal failure, irrespective of the level ofthe plasma phosphate.  the size of the glands and theeffects of sub-total parathyroidectomy in patients of thisgroup suggest that the normal plasma calcium resultsfrom an increased production of parathyroid hormone.the more advanced renal failure in the normocalcemic,as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could meanthat the development of an effective degree of secondaryhyperparathyroidism is a function of the duration of therenal disease.  it seems likely that when the parathyroidresponse is sufficient to overcome the effects of the vitamind resistance it also entails the development of generalizedosteitis fibrosa, healing of the defect of mineralizationand increased liability to metastatic calcification.

mammalian cell cultures contaminated withpleuropneumonia-like organismsii. effect of pplo on cell morphology in establishedmonolayer culturesthe occurrence of cytopathogenic changes in monolayer cultures ofpplo-contaminated mammalian cells has been shown to be related todeficiency of arginine in the medium.  the same effects were seen when thecell culture medium was depleted by pplo prior to application to pplo-freecell cultures even though viable pplo were no longer present.  the fact thatthe same picture resulted in the absence of pplo when either arginine orglucose were omitted from the medium would indicate that, while the defi-ciency created under the conditions described was specific, the cellularchanges could as well be the result of omission or depletion of other mam-malian cell growth requirements.  the importance of surveillance of celllines for the presence of pplo to avoid misinterpretation of cytopathogeniceffects was stressed.

effect of parathyroidectomy and ferric dextrinupon calciphylactic sensitization by uremiaexperiments on the rat indicate that calciphy-lactic sensitization can be achieved by bilateralnephrectomy.  intravenous administration of aferric dextrin preparation (fe-din) inducesselective calcification in the buccal mucosa,esophagus, trachea and mediastinum of thenephrectomized rat although it produces no suchchanges in intact control animals.  conversely,fe-din prevents the cardiovascular calcificationnormally elicited by nephrectomy.  parathy-roidectomy protects the nephrectomized ratagainst the fe-din-induced calciphylaxis.hence, it may be concluded that: 1) autologousparathyroid hormone, in amounts secreted bythe glands, can act as a calciphylactic sensitizerand 2) fe-din is highly effective in protecting thecardiovascular system against uremic damage.
