j. clin. endocr. 1965, 25/4 (457-464).antagonism between parathyroid extract and adrenalcortical steroids in man.metabolic balance studies were done in 2patients with hypoparathyroidism whoreceived hydrocortisone of prednisoneduring the administration of parathyroidextract.  administration of prednisone wasassociated with phosphate retention,decreased urinary ca, decreased serumca, citrate and glycoprotein concentrations,and increased serum phosphate.excretion of parathyroid activity in theurine of 1 patient was uninfluenced by theadministration of prednisone.  it is concludedthat the antagonistic effect of theadrenal cortical steroids was expressedat the biochemical sites of action of theparathyroid extract in bone and kidney,that the steroids reduce parathyroid secretionbut that their administration probably does notresult in degradation or inactivation ofthe hormone.

3752. steroid excretion in early breast cancerpatients with advanced breast cancerwho subsequently fail to respond to adrenalec-tomy or hypophysectomy have beenfound to excrete abnormal amounts of theurinary metabolites of androgen andcortisol.  when similar measurements arecarried out on patients with early breastcancer, it is found that approximately halfthe cases presenting for mastectomy arealso excreting abnormal amounts of thesesteroids.  subsequent follow-up shows thatthese cases tend to have a poor progno-sis, and a trial had therefore been startedin which the abnormality is being cor-rected.  in addition, it seems possible thatthe deficiency in adrogen excretion mayprecede the onset of the disease.  thisproblem is being investigated in a trialinvolving urinary steroid estimations in5000 normal women.  the measurementsare being compared with the subsequentdevelopment of breast cancer.

2366. the excretion of oestrone,pregnanediol and pregnanetriol in breastcancer patients.  ii. effect of ovariectomy,ovarian irradiation and corticos-teroids.the urinary excretion of oestrone,pregnanediol and pregnanetriol was determinedin breast cancer patients at differentstages of their endocrine treatment.  theresults demonstrate that corticosteroidsin substitution doses (cortisone 50 mg. dailyor prednisone 10 mg. daily, divided in 4daily doses) are very effective in depressingthe excretion of all 3 steroids in postmenopausalpatients.  this is in agreement withthe clinical impression that these easily toleratedsmall doses of corticosteroids havethe same therapeutic effect as adrenalectomy inpatients with breast cancer.  theresults indicate that the ovaries may contributeto the production of oestrogens formany years after the menopause, and that thisproduction is depressed by ovarianirradiation.  this is in agreement with the clinicalobservation that ovarian irra-diation has a therapeutic value in postmenopausalwomen with breast cancer.

the importance of steroid hormones in hyperbilirubinemia, and icterusof the newborn.administration of naturally occurring steroids(estriol, pregnanediol, cortisone)between the 7th and the 11th day of life increasesthe bilirubin level of these newborns.administration of the same steroidsor of progesterone to nursing mothersresults in hyperbilirubinemia of their infants.these facts explain the pathogenesisof neonatal jaundice.  interpretation of theexperimental and clinical findings leadsto the conclusion that the high amount ofsteroid hormones which must be excretedduring the neonatal period in conjunctionwith the relative insufficiency of the neonatalliver is responsible for the inabilityto conjugate bilirubin with glucuronic acid.the steroid hormones probably competewith bilirubin for the enzyme and substratenecessary for conjugation.  the functionalcapacity of the neonatal liver isnot high enough to conjugate both bilirubinand steroids.  only after excretion of theplacental steroids does sufficient conjugationof bilirubin become possible.  furthermore,pregnanediol appears to inhibit theenzyme glucuronyl transferase.  thesemechanisms show the importance of steroidhormones in the pathogenesis of neonataljaundice and their importance as anaggravating factor in the development ofjaundice due to erythroblastosis.  these newlydeveloped concepts may have therapeuticimplications on which the author willreport at a later date.

antidiuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazidein diabetes insipidusand ch'iuan-lu12 cases of diabetes insipiduswere studied during hydrochlorothia-zide therapy under a fixed diet.  thesymptoms, blood pressure, urinaryvolume, blood and urinary electrolytes,plasma volume, electrocardiogram andhypertonic saline intravenous drip testwere compared before and after treat-ment.a daily dose of 100-150 mgbrought down the urinary volume toabout 50% of the pretreatment value.the initial antidiuretic effect was noted8 hours after medication and themaximal effect after the fourth or fifthday.  owing to the kaluretic action ofthe drug, 2-4 gm of potassium salt wasalso given each day.  satisfactory re-sults were obtained with dietary sodiumion at not more than 200 meq daily, butingestion of excessive table salt fre-quently diminished or even destroyedthe therapeutic effect.the physical signs, blood pres-sure and ecg were essentially un-changed and the plasma volumes werealtered after treatment.  the hyper-tonic saline test was improved in someof the patients.low salt syndrome was fre-quently encountered as the therapycontinued over 1 month.  but this andeven secondary failure could be pre-vented by timely use of intermittent oralternative regimen.the therapeutic mechanism,indications and side effects of the drugwere briefly discussed.  the drug mightpossibly act through the mechanism ofsalt depletion, contraction of extracel-lular fluid volume and decrease of renalglomerular filtrate, and in consequenceurinary volume decreases and thirst isalleviated.

antidiuretic properties of chlorothiazidein diabetes insipidus dogschlorothiazide was found to decreaseurine volume and increase urine con-centration in diabetes insipidus dogs.there was no change in gfr, rpf,tmpah, plasma volume, extracellularfluid or total body water.  the one con-sistent altered function was a decreasein "free water" clearance.  diazoxide andmercuhydrin were not antidiuretic.  it isbelieved that the antidiuretic action isdependent on the chlorothiazide-inducedsaluresis.  although the mechanism ofthis antidiuresis has not been clearly de-fined, it seems best explained by postu-lating a decrease in filtrate reaching thedistal nephron (giving a decreased finalurine volume) coupled with inhibition ofsolute reabsorption in the distal tubule(preventing the selective reabsorption ofsolute in the distal tubule that is nor-mally seen, accounting for the increasein urine concentration).  the possiblerole of the mineralocorticoids in theantidiuretic response to chlorothiazidetherapy was investigated in diabetes in-sipidus and adrenalectomized dogs.  ad-ministration of sodium-retaining steroidsto diabetes insipidus dogs did not re-produce the urinary changes associatedwith chlorothiazide therapy.  in addition,the antidiuretic response to chlorothia-zide was not altered by adrenalectomyor spironolactone administration.  there-fore, the presence of the sodium-retain-ing steroids are not essential for the anti-diuretic response of chlorothiazide indiabetes insipidus.

studies with human growth hormoneten dwarfed patients whose short stature was ofvarying aetiology were studied by investigation ofsome of the metabolic effects of human growthhormone, 10 mg. being administered daily for aperiod of 5 to 9 days.  the patients were maintainedon a constant diet during a preliminary controlperiod, while receiving hgh, and in 7 patients from2 to 7 days in the post-hgh period.  hgh produceda reduction in serum cholesterol, with arebound on withdrawal, in 7; a delayed clearance offat from the blood after a fat load in 9; and theappearance of pre-b lipoprotein in the fasting state,as measured by paper electrophoresis, in all of them.the fall in serum cholesterol and the rebound onwithdrawal of hgh has some relevance to theobservation that hypercholesterolaemia occurs insome hypopituitary patients even in the absence ofhypothyroidism.no change was observed in tests of thyroid andadrenocortical function during the short-term highdosage administration of hgh.hypopituitary patients show a considerableretention of nitrogen on hgh administration, andwe have confirmed the work of prader and hiscolleagues that this provides a valuable diagnostictest for growth hormone deficiency.  the measurementof urinary nitrogen excretion after the withdrawalof hgh also promises to be a useful investigationin the differential diagnosis of short stature.nitrogen excretion in the withdrawal phase inhypopituitary children returns slowly to its pre-hghlevels; two non-hypopituitary dwarfedchildren excreted much more nitrogen in the withdrawalperiod than they retained in the hghperiod.  one primordial dwarf showed a negligiblechange in urinary nitrogen excretion both in thehgh and in the post-hgh periods.

pleuropneumonia-like organismsdespite their small size, the pplo carrythe full complement of the chemical com-pounds and enzymes contained in largerbacteria and in cells.  they contain bothdna and rna, and in their independentmetabolism they are essentially like other freeliving cells in contrast to the viruses whichhave no independent metabolism outside theliving host cell.  several strains of pplo havebeen cultivated from the mucous membranesof apparently normal human subjects, espe-cially from the respiratory and urinary tracts.until recently, however, definite evidence ofthe association between the pplo and clear-ly defined clinical disease in the human sub-ject was lacking.  in 1962 it became evidentthat the so-called eaton "virus," originallyisolated by eaton and his associates in 1944from patients with primary atypical pneu-monia, was in reality a pleuropneumonia-likeorganism.  typical pplo colonies are pro-duced on a cell-free agar medium which isenriched by the addition of blood serum oryeast.  a number of strains of pplo has nowbeen identified, and in recognition of theirunique characteristics, they have been classi-fied in a separate order, the mycoplasmatales,genus mycoplasma.

the aetiology and treatment ofurinary calculusinvestigations in this laboratory have beenbased on the hypothesis that calculus formation isprimarily a process of crystallization from super-saturated solutions rather than one of adsorptionon a specific protein matrix, as has been postulatedby boyce and his colleagues (boyce and king,1963).  that crystallization is the primary factoris strongly suggested by the recent studies ofvermeulen, lyon and gill (1964).  these authorsproduced artificial concretions which closelyresembled urinary calculi by immersing a rotatingwire loop in normal urine for several days andslowly adding the appropriate stone-formingelements.if the above hypothesis is correct then thefactors of primary interest in urinary stoneformation are those responsible for supersaturation,nucleation and crystal poisoning.  much remainsto be learnt about these various factors, theirinter-relationships, and their relative importance.the significance of the urinary colloids (proteins,muco-proteins and polysaccharides) in calculusformation is still not clear but it is probable thatthey play an important secondary role in bindingcrystalline precipitates to form a non-friablecalculus.  since time is an important factor incrystal growth such non-specific binding byproteins would increase the chances of stonegrowth and retention within the upper urinarytract.

effects of short term administration ofhysiological doses of human growth hormonein three patients with turner's syndromeh. e. sjobergthe effect of apparently physiological doses of human growth hormonewas investigated in three patients with turner's syndrome in short termmetabolic balance studies.  the subjects presented an abnormal sex chro-mosome constitution and an increased level of sulphation factor activityin serum.two dose levels of hormone were used, and there appeared an anabolicresponse to both.  no correlation with dose was obtained for any of theparameters used except for urinary magnesium, where the retention wasgreater with the higher dose.  the sulphation factor activity of serum in-creased during hormone administration in the one case studied in thisrespect.the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was within the normal range inthe two patients studied in this respect, and was not altered by growthhormone.all patients had an increased urinary excretion of creatine which atpresent cannot be explained.  the creatinuria diminished during growthhormone treatment.the mechanism behind the retarded growth is discussed.  it is suggestedthat a major factor might be a defect in the center for linear growth,i.e. the epiphyses that would make these less responsive to all the factorsnormally stimulating the growth processes in the epiphyseal zones.

epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) as a therapeutic agent based on 5years clinical experience.experience in the treatment of 744 patients withe-aca suggested that the use of the preparation is indicatedin the following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhagein association with delivery.  (2) acute systemicfibrinolysis in association with surgery.  it ismainly major operations on the thorax, pancreas, prostate,liver and genital organs that are complicated byfibrinolysis, but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur afterany operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis in patientswith cancer, particularly cancer of the prostateand pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicatingvarious disorders, especially leukaemia, livercirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote inthrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activityin the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduceblood losses following prostatectomy, especially if thetreatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopicallyclear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumaticinjury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia andother coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effectivewhether given orally or intravenously.  in stateswith increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity inthe urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day hasproved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug one.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function testswere observed, not even in cases receiving more than1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs ofintravascular coagulation in connection with e-acatherapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications after prostatectomy in patientstreated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.judging from the authors' experience in this materiale-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.

the antidiuretic mechanism of hydrochlorothia-zide in the treatment of diabetes insipidusthe changes in water and electro-lyte balance during hydrochlorothiazidetherapy in 2 patients with vasopressin-deficient diabetes insipidus were studi-ed.  in 1 case, under fixed daily so-dium intake, the urinary sodium excre-tion markedly increased on the first dayof treatment, but the urinary volumebegan to fall on the second day and per-sisted low for 3 days after discontinua-tion of the drug.  in the other case theurinary volume markedly decreasedwhen the daily sodium intake was strict-ly limited.  it further decreased onhydrochlorothiazide therapy but aftersodium intake was restored it returnedto the pretreatment level despite con-tinued use of the drug.the antidiuretic action of hydro-chlorothiazide in the treatment of dia-betes insipidus is believed to be relatedto the sodium depletion state of the bodybrought about by increased output ordecreased intake of sodium.  sodiumand water reabsorption in the proximalconvoluted tubules in the kidney in-creases and the amount of glomerularfiltrate reaching the distal convolutedtubules decreases.  thus the finalurinary volume falls.

198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note ofcautionazathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classifiedas 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects ofazathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because ofthe concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during theadministration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolongedsteroid therapy.  in 1 patient, the administration of azathioprine wasassociated with amelioration of an arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum which didnot respond to the use of steroids and other medication.  immuno-suppressiveobservations were limited.  the established delayed hypersensitivity response,as reflected in various skin tests, was unchanged during the administration ofazathioprine.  azathioprine had no discernible toxic effects upon the kidneysor the liver in 2 patients, 1 with postnecrotic cirrhosis and the other withserum hepatitis.  gastro-intestinal symptoms (anorexia, epigastric discomfort,and nausea) occurred in 8 patients.  mild to moderate leukopenia developed in 8patients and, in 2 individuals, was accompanied by thrombocytopenia.  temporaryalopecia occurred in 1 woman.  the hematopoietic effects developed within 2 or3 wk of therapy with azathioprine at a dosage level of 4-6 mg/kg/day.azathioprine does not exert the rapid beneficial effect in ulcerative colitisnoted with corticotropin and adrenal corticosteroids.  therefore, its use insevere ulcerative colitis requiring intensive therapy probably is undesirable.azathioprine, on the basis of these initial observations, may be considered formoderately severe ulcerative colitis, under circumstances permitting controlledand prolonged therapeutic trial as adjunct medication, but with carefulsupervision for prevention of toxicity, especially leukopenia.

decrease in serum and urinary phosphorus in manin the course of pyrotherapyduring the feverpeak occurring a few hours after the in-jection, urinary phosphorus (up) dis-appears entirely.  this fact cannot beaccounted for by the parallel decrease ingfr, because serum phosphorus level(sp) does not increase (as it would beexpected to, should retention occur) buton the contrary, it, too, declines to amarked degree.the possibility that changes in sp andup could have been brought about by anincreased utilization of glucose was alsoconsidered.  an intravenous glucose toler-ance test (method of macho and licko(8)) was carried out in another group ofpatients on control days and on days ofpyrotherapy five hours after the pyrogenadministration.  an increase in the rate of"glucose utilization" was observed(table 2).  however a different opinion isfound in the literature.  in the course ofglucose tolerance tests, conn (3) andcomparini (9) observed a lowered rate ofglucose utilization in febrile subjects.malizia (10) found an accentuated rateof decline of serum phosphorus duringglucose tolerance tests in subjects withhigh temperatures, but the glycemicresponses did not differ from those ob-tained when controls without fever weresubjected to the same tests.  whether itbe for utilization purposes or not, thefact remains that a massive transfer ofphosphorus from the serum into thetissues takes place in fever.

3927. studies on growth and cytomorphosisin the thymo-lympha-tic systems - with specialreference to the influence ofthe thymus and the thyroidin guinea-pigsmigratory streams of lymphocytes betweendifferent parts of the thymo-lymphaticsystem were evaluated by comparisons betweenlymphocyte populations in thoracic-duct lymph and arterial and venous blood,especially thymic venous blood.  by re-cording organ weights in sham-operated andthymectomized guinea-pigs, treatedwith thyroxin or untreated, the importanceof the thymus and the thyroid for growthand regeneration in the thymo-lymphaticsystem was studied.  the main results areas follows.  there is a considerable venousoutput of lymphocytes with low mito-chondrial content (small lymphocytes) fromthe thymus in normal young guinea-pigs.this explains the much higher incidence ofsmall lymphocytes in blood than in tho-racic-duct lymph.  neonatal thymectomycauses lymphatic hypotrophy with defi-ciency of lymphocytes and pyroninophiliccells in relation to reticular ones.  bodygrowth and survival of the animals are notaffected.  in the thymus, exogenousthyroxin most probably promotes differentiationof large basophilic cells to smalllymphocytes, resulting in an increased output ofsmall lymphocytes.  in the lymphnodes, thyroxin promotes differentiation of largepyroninophilic cells ('transitionalcells') into immature and mature plasma cells.the effects of thyroxin on dif-ferentiation are followed by an increased growthof the thymo-lymphatic organs,characterized by an increased incidence of largebasophilic cells and increased weightof the lymphatic organs.  growth of the thymus andlymph nodes precedes that ofthe red splenic pulp.  this delayed splenic responseis not due to a transformationof an increased number of immigrated thymiclymphocytes, as neonatal thymectomydoes not prevent the thyroxin-stimulatedoccurrence of large basophilic cells in thered splenic pulp.  the thyroxin-stimulatedgrowth of the lymphatic system is ac-companied by an increased output of largerlymphocytes through the thoracicduct, resulting in an increased number oflarger lymphocytes in the blood.  inpostnatally thymectomized animals, having anormal (or above normal) amount ofcirculating small lymphocytes, thyroxin producesa drastic decrease in the number ofsmall blood lymphocytes, indicating a decreaseddelivery and/or increased disappear-ance of these cells to and from the blood, respectively.this decrease in number of smalllymphocytes is not seen in sham-operated animals.as judged by studies of organweights, the thyroxin-stimulated growth andregeneration of the lymphatic tissueare influenced antagonistically by thymectomyand synergistically by local factorsin involuted tissue.

the periodicity of microfilariae.x. the relation between the circadian temperature cycleof monkeys and the microfilarial cycle.monkeys were used whose blood contained the microfilariae of edesonfilariamalayensis, which has a nocturnal periodicity.artificial lowering of the body temperature during the daytime caused themicrofilaria count in the blood to rise; and artificial raising of the bodytemperature during the night caused it to fall almost to zero, i.e. inversionof the normal circadian temperature rhythm of the body was followed byinversion of the microfilarial rhythm.the hypothesis is put forward that the circadian rhythm of the microfilariaeof e. malayensis (but probably not of the microfilariae of some other species)is entrained by the circadian rhythm of body temperature, which thus providesthe "effective stimuli" to which these microfilariae respond.

1545. the effect of combined glucose and insulin infusions onthe lipoid and carbohydrate metabolism of the parturientwoman and of the fetusthe infusion of glucose with insulin during deliverywas used by the authors pri-marily in order to determine, whether the utilizationof glucose can be enhancedunder these conditions.  they wanted to investigate,whether the increase of unesteri-fied fatty acids in the cord blood which takes placeafter a sole glucose infusion inthe mother, could be caused by the low capabilityof glucose utilization in the fetus.the infusion during delivery which consisted of theapplication of 500 ml of 10%glucose and 16 u of insulin over a period of 30 min.brought about a greater decreaseof unesterified fatty acids in the parturient womanas compared with the infusion ofglucose exclusively.  the reason for this resultis thought to be due to a better utili-zation of glucose which is favorably influencedby insulin.  during the infusion ofglucose with insulin, an increase in the valuesof lactic and pyruvic acid took placein the parturient women; this was probably dueto an accelerated glycolysis and anincreased production of lactic acid, but notcaused by a higher share of the anaerobicmetabolism.  in the cord blood, there werelikewise increased values of lactic and py-ruvic acid as a reflection of the higher valuesof these substances in the mother.  theformation of these products of metabolicbreakdown by the fetus, however, was notsignificantly increased.  after infusion ofglucose with insulin, the other investigatedparameter values, including those of the levelsof unesterified fatty acids are foundin the cord blood in similar amounts as afterinfusion of glucose alone.  these re-sults cannot reliably prove the passage ofinsulin through the placenta especiallyafter a continued study of the metabolic valuesin newborns.  as a proof of the passageof insulin through the placenta could not beestablished, it is possible that after anintake of insulin the increase of unesterifiedfatty acids in the cord blood could becaused by a relative insufficiency of the insularapparatus of the fetus.  the mostprobable reason for the increase of unesterifiedfatty acids is the different depo-sition and metabolization of unesterified fattyacids in the course of intrauterinelife.

studies on eperythrozoon infection in sheepthe intravenous inoculation of blood from sheep in the parasi-taemic stage of eperythrozoon infection produced detectableparasitaemia in recipient sheep within 7 days.  the parasitaemialasted from 3 to 12 weeks and was accompanied by anaemia andoccasionally by icterus.  no other symptoms developed and in acontrolled experiment on hoggs there was no significant differencein weight gain between infected and control animals.a concurrent attack of tick-borne fever led to the disappearanceof eperythrozoon from the circulating blood.  it is suggested that thisphenomenon may be caused by the pyrexia.the incubation period following the inoculation of infected bloodin ten 3 to 4 week old lambs varied from 3 to 6 weeks.  in eight ofthese animals the symptoms were less severe than in adult sheep, butthe two smallest lambs developed a profound anaemia and failed togain weight.culture of the organism on sheep blood agar or on sheep kidneymonolayers was unsuccessful as was the attempted transmission ofthe infection to mice.the transference of keds and lice from infected to uninfectedsheep failed to transmit the infection, but a sheep was infected by theintravenous inoculation of ground-up lice from an infected animal.the only characteristic histopathological changes in infectedsheep were lymphoid hyperplasia of the malphigian corpuscles in thespleen and deposition of haemosiderin in the cells of the proximalconvoluted tubules in the kidney cortex.

chromosomal patterns in cancer patients during treatment .radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and throughshort-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can beassessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because ofthe large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the courseof treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variationsfrom the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structuralaberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grownprior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us todetermine the variation .stained preparations examined microscopically allow us to recognizethese abnormalities which are apparent before, during, and afterradiotherapy . the damage appears to be largely random in thechromosomes affected in the different cancers, and the specificaberrations differ from cell to cell . however, there does seem to besome correlation between the appearance of persistent aberrantchromosomes and their frequency . while the peak incidence or /plateau/may remain unchanged, the frequency may change .

4612. flow considerations in regional cerebral hypothermiait is suggested that low flows are dangerousand may cause anoxia either directlyor by interfering with cooling.  sixty dogshave been subjected to local cerebralhypothermia by the method of femoral tocarotid cooling of arterial blood with per-fusion at a predetermined pressure ratherthan predetermined flow rate.  the cir-cuit is described and its advantages forclinical use mentioned together with its in-accuracies as a method of scientific investigation.these are chiefly concernedwith maintenance of systemic blood pressurewhich may require the injection ofpressor agents.  evidence for reduction in flowat low temperatures is discussedand evidence presented that this is not only dueto increase in viscosity but thatthere is an active spasm, manifested by'rewarming humps' which occur in thecooling graphs.  mean carotid flow rateswere determined by a revolution counterattached to a pump of fixed stroke volume,the output of which was linked to the per-fusion pressure and thus determined by the resistance.the place of added co2is discussed particularly in relation to the fallin partial pressure which accompa-nies the cooling of the blood.  the addition of 5% co2did not increase total carotidflows.  halothane had been used as an anestheticbecause of its sympatholytic ac-tion.  it has increased flows by 37% andabolished 'rewarming humps'.  rheomacro-dex used as a priming fluid instead of bloodproduced increased flow averaging 75%but did not abolish spasm.  it is suggested thatcooling faster than 1 c. per minuteis not intrinsically dangerous if spasm is preventedand high flow maintained by the methods described.
