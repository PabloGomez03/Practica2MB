cortisone and atypical pulmonary /epithelial/ hyperplasia furtherstudies including electron microscopy, tissue culture, animaltransplantation and long term observations .previous work in rabbits showed that there was a proliferation ofcells within pulmonary alveoli following intratracheal injection ofnitric acid and that the proliferation was greatly enhanced by theadministration of cortisone to the animals .electron microscopic observations indicated that these weremorphologically large alveolar lining cells . tissue culture studies ofdamaged and normal lung with and without cortisone showed no evidencefor a direct effect of the drug on the proliferation of these cells .this observation, together with the knowledge that fibrosis wasdelayed in the cortisone treated animals, support the thesis that thecortisone effect is an indirect one . transplantation of damaged lungtissue to hamster cheek pouch failed to reveal evidence of growth .within the period of observation (99 to 420 days) there was evidencethat the proliferation subsided considerably and no neoplasms developed

the pathogenesis of viral influenzal pneumonia in mice .the pathogenesis of influenzal pneumonia in mice was studied byelectron microscopy . mice were inoculated with 1.5 ld of pr8 influenzavirus and killed at varying intervals after inoculation . observationsby light microscopy were correlated with those by electron microscopy inorder to evaluate the lesions produced .at the periphery, the earliest lesions were focal areas of edema ofalveolar lining cells, the capillary endothelium and the interposedbasement membrane . this caused an appreciable thickening of theblood-air pathway . hypertrophy, degeneration and desquamation of thealveolar lining and proliferation of alveolar macrophages resulted incomplete consolidation, which was progressive up to 1 week afterinfection .the central areas of the lung were affected somewhat differently . at3 days after infection, the nonciliated bronchiolar cells showedconsiderable hyperplasia of endoplasmic reticulum and apical cytoplasmicedema . viral particles matured at the lumen surface of these cells andwere then released into the bronchiolar lumen . the bronchiolar cells,both ciliated and nonciliated, underwent degeneration and sloughed intothe bronchiolar lumen . the regenerating epithelium was stratified, andthe surface cells were elongated and flattened . the peribronchiolarinterstitial tissue gradually became totally infiltrated by cells,mostly of the mononuclear type .

palliation by radiotherapythe purpose of radiotherapy in the managementof cancer of the lung is first to cure the disease;second, to prolong useful and comfortable exist-ence; and third, to provide comfort and relief ofsuffering to those who are symptomatic and in-curable.cancers of the lung vary quite widely in theirresponse to radiation.  those of glandular origin,the adenocarcinoma, are more often than not ofmodest susceptibility and sometimes quite resis-tant.  the very undifferentiated, the so-called oat-cell cancers, are often of exquisite sensitivity, re-sponding to irradiation almost like lymphomas.most cancer of the lung, however, is squamous-cellcarcinoma and as such may be considered to bemoderately radiosensitive in much the same orderof magnitude as squamous-cell carcinoma of theskin, cervix or larynx, and should, in theory, becurable by this means in the same degree.  unfor-tunately, this has to date not been found to betrue.  the reasons are principally two: first andforemost, by the time a diagnosis is made, cancerof the lung has more often than not, estimated at80% and more, spread beyond the site of origin,thus making cure by any effective means presentlyavailable unlikely.  second, the substrate in whichthe cancer grows, the lung, tolerates radiation lesswell than do the tissues which surround the highlyradiocurable epithelial cancers such as carcinoma ofthe skin, cervix, and larynx, thus making an un-favorable therapeutic ratio.

electron microscopic studies of mycoplasma (pplo strain 880) inartificial medium and in tissue culture.mycoplasma strain 880, isolated from a leukemicpatient, was studied in brothcultures and in several cell culture lines.this strain exhibited considerable pleomorphismin size, internal structure, andshape, including forms with filamentousprojections.  the most common form observedwas 0.5 to 1 in diameter andhad a nuclear area of fibrillar strands, probablydna.  the cytoplasm of the organismscontained ribosome-like granules anda flattened vacuole which indented thenuclear area.  there were various other forms,including 'elementary bodies' 100min diameter that were very electron-dense.in the tissue culture lines in whichthe cells grew as a monolayer, the mycoplasmawere closely associated with thecell surface and were occasionally seen inmembrane-lined cytoplasmic vacuoles.in cell lines that did not attach to the glass,the mycoplasma were fewer and notattached to the cell surface.  although theultrastructure of this strain is similarto that of previously described strains, thereare differences in details of structurewhich may be related either to the growthconditions used or to characteristics ofthe strain.  the various forms of the organismare consistent with the suggestionthat mycoplasma may have several mechanismsof reproduction (growth).  the intracellularmycoplasma may be protected fromantibiotics.  this would partly explainthe difficulty of eradicating mycoplasma frominfected cell cultures.

1688. surface phenomena in lungs in health and diseasein summary, the authors have attemptedto bring together the multiple observationswhich seem germane to the understandingof surface phenomena in lungs in healthand disease.  to this end, the contributionsof anatomists and pathologists on thefine structure of alveolar cells and theirlining are fundamental.  the concepts ofalveolar stability required the specialinsights of physiologists who were concernedwith the causes of bubble stability asthey related to the particular problems posedby a lung of several millions of bubblesarranged in parallel.  soon the contributionsof the chemists became significant asmethods of identification and assay of the al-veolar lining material were of interest.clinicians asked what relevance these studieshad to atelectasis as it occurs in disease,and soon the question of when the surfac-tant appeared in development occurred tothose concerned with premature infants.students of metabolism began to focus onthe lung as a site of phospholipid synthesis,and their tools seem most promising atthis time in unearthing possible errors inmetabolism which may express themselvesin disease.  surgeons who undertake per-fusion of the isolated lung ask therequirements of that organ with respect to thenutrients and environment of the alveolarcells, and anesthesiologists inquire intothe possibilities of mechanical injuryto the alveoli during artificial respiration.the problems posed to the reviewersof a subject which touches so many disciplinesare obvious.  doubtless some pertinentstudies have been omitted although uninten-tionally; others may have beenmisinterpreted through lack of qualifications as spe-cialists in all specialties.  theauthors hope they have provided evidence that theforces of surface tension cannotbe ignored in an organ with an air-liquid interfaceof some 70 m2.  they further hopethey have described some of the properties ofthe film at the alveolar-air interfacewhich operate to produce stability of the alveoli.they hold the belief that study of themetabolism of the alveolar lining layer willfurther their understanding of a numberof disease processes in which it may bealtered.  and lastly, they hope for muchcloser communication between workers inmany disciplines who can elucidate thisremarkable subject best through cooperativestudies.

617. maturation of postnatal human lung and the idiopathic respiratory distresssyndromematuration and pathologic alterations of the lungin 19 newborn infants who died of idiopathic respiratorydistress syndrome were studied by light-and electronmicroscopy.  normal lungs from 6 fetuses and 11 new-borns served as controls.  in all infants with idiopathicrespiratory distress syndrome, respiratory bronchio-les and alveolar ducts usually presented the histologicpattern of mature lungs, i.e. they were predominantlylined by type i cells, which also formed the epithelialcomponent of most blood-air barriers.  well expandedalveoli exhibited a similar pattern, whereas collapsedalveoli were lined by numerous type ii cells which par-ticipated in the formation of poorly developed blood-airbarriers.  the capacity of type ii cells to produce in-clusion bodies seemed to increase with survival beyondthe 14th hr of age.  secretion of inclusion bodies andpresumably surfactant into alveolar spaces did occurbut only in the lungs of infants older than 2 days.  how-ever, this process was not accompanied by reductionin the number of type ii cells per alveolus as in the nor-mal lung.  the distribution of pathologic changes in idio-pathic respiratory distress syndrome appeared to bedetermined by the degree of maturity of the air sacs.structurally mature air sacs were associated with da-mage of epithelial lining and hyaline membrane forma-tion.  in contrast, collapsed alveoli revealed an intactepithelial lining and marked septal edema but were freeof hyaline membranes.  the findings of this study sug-gested that transudation of plasma through well develop-ed blood-air barriers was responsible for epithelialdamage and hyaline-membrane formation in air sacs.they also suggested that alveolar collapse and presuma-bly lack of surfactant were related to abnormal matura-tion of the epithelial lining and to septal edema.

3748. four separate tumour clones derived from a transplantable pleo-morphic carcinoma of the lung in a heterozygous mousea metastasising pleomorphic adenocarcinomain the lung of an untreated hetero-zygous male mouse was successfullytransplanted to 4 brothers by the 'plating'technique of henderson and rous.  by'plating' multiple small grafts in air bells inthe subcutaneous tissues of the new hostsit was possible to select 4 different clonesof transplantable tumour for further study.the histological peculiarities ofdifferent parts of the original tumourwere reproduced in the different clones a i,ii, iii, and b.  retrospective studyof the primary tumour and of its metastasesprovided some interesting clues to routesof metastasis and the selective survival ofmalignant cells.  it is concluded that bythe cloning of transplantable cells, at thefirst serial passage, valuable informationabout the histogenesis and potentialmalignancy of the primary tumour can beobtained.  lastly, the highly malignantcharacter of 4 clones of tumour cells apparentlyderived from the familiar clinicallybenign adenoma of the mouse lung maybe of some interest, from the point ofview of prognosis based on histology.

recovery of mycoplasmas in the study ofhuman leukaemia and other malignanciesnumerous reports have been published concerning thenecessity of testing for the presence of mycoplasmas beforethe interpretation of experiments performed in cellcultures.  such tests are especially important whenthe presence of viruses is suspected, since recent evidenceindicates that some mycoplasmas are capable of elicitinga transmissible cytopathic effect.in addition, some mycoplasmas and viruses shareproperties, such as size, filterability, morphology inelectron microscopy, sensitivity to ether, ability tohaemagglutinate and cause haemadsorption, interferencewith virus replication in vitro, lack of inhibition by certaincommonly used antibiotics and inhibition of growth byhomologous antiserum.  thus, the absence of ordinarybacteria and moulds in preparations eliciting a cytopathiceffect in cell cultures is an unreliable criterion for viralidentification.  great caution should be exercised inclassifying new agents as viruses, especially as myxo-viruses, without adequate testing to exclude their identityas mycoplasmas.

2774. pitfalls in the clinical and histologic diagnosis of broncho-genic carcinomaa necropsy study of 380 cases of extrathoraciccarcinoma revealed that pulmonarymetastases occurred in almost 50% of thecases and bronchial metastases in over25%.  there were 39 cases (10.3%) in theseries with clinical features simulatingbronchogenic carcinoma and in 24 (62%)of these cases there was cytologic and/orhistologic confirmation.  carcinomas ofthe pancreas presented the greatest sourceof diagnostic error accounting for morethan one-third of the 39 cases; the primarysite second in frequency was carcinomaof the kidney.  bronchial metastases werechiefly responsible for the clinical,cytologic, and histologic findings compatiblewith the diagnosis of bronchogeniccarcinoma.  secondary growths in the lungs maypresent roentgenologically as solitarytumors indistinguishable from primary lungcancer.  metastatic lesions in lymphnodes, bronchi, and lung may exhibit pleomor-phic features simulating squamouscell carcinoma.  the diagnosis of bronchioloalveo-lar carcinoma in resected lung tissueis a presumptive conclusion inasmuch as theidentical morphological features maybe reproduced by metastases from duct orglandular carcinomas.  the simulationof bronchogenic carcinoma by metastatic tum-ors occurs with sufficient frequency tochallenge the diagnostic accuracy of deathscertified as bronchogenic carcinomawith necropsy exclusion of other primary sites.

factors influencing development of tumors in frogs .(1) study of 75 spontaneous tumors of vermont frogs showed threepathological grades of malignancy present.. aggressive renaladenocarcinoma in some 30 per cent, medium adenocarcinoma in 50 percent, and lower grade mixed with tumors of undetermined origin in theremaining 20 per cent .(2) correlation with parasite infections (trematodes) was demonstrablein only few cases in the kidney . hyperplasias and neoplasias gradinginto lung primary carcinoma have been found in the lung in r. pipiens .temperatures below 15 c. protected animals from lung as well as kidneydisease . higher temperatures disturbed the host-parasite relationshipsand led to higher incidence of malignancy . in the bullfrog, precancerwas clearly associated with the worm attachment discs .(3) other histological types of tumors in vermont frogs includedlymphosarcomas, liposarcoma, mesothelioma, epithelioma, and adrenal andcartilage tumors of uncertain malignancy .(4) improved methods of obtaining tumor filtrates allowed greaterprobability of inducing malignancy with direct renal injection . in 106frogs 37 per cent developed histologically provable cancers in theranges of three to seven months . twenty-six per cent showed somepre-cancer response and 43 per cent were negative . within the seriesreceiving filtrate from high malignancy donors one group yielded 100 percent positive, the others 50 and 38 per cent, respectively .(5) among animals injected with /low/ malignancy filtrate, fewertumors resulted . some of these were clearly vesicular carcinomas andcould be classed as lung tumors .(6) improved tissue culture methods allowed explants to live in liquidmedia under perforated cellophane up to one year . slower growth, aidedby lower temperatures (16 c.) improved the microecology of cell typesand allowed detailed daily observations of each cell's intranuclear andintranucleolar physiology for extended time-lapse cine-photography .(7) mechanisms for malignant transformation are related to increasedactivity and production of nucleolar dna and rna . the infective dnahypothesis is not classical virus theory, but it does offer detailedsupport .

1560. the ultrastructure of the lungs of lambs.  the relation of osmiophilicinclusions and alveolar lining layer to fetal maturation and experimentallyproduced respiratory distressthe lungs in 69 fetal and newborn lambswere studied.  osmiophilic inclusion bodiesfirst appeared at about 121 days gestationand their total number increased withmaturation.  normal surface activity oflung extracts was detectable a few daysfollowing the appearance of inclusionbodies.  the excretory nature of the type iialveolar epithelial cell, the phospholipidnature of the inclusion body content, thedecrease in the number of inclusionbodies and their loss of density associatedwith respiratory distress and with theloss of normal surface activity of lung ex-tracts provide strong evidence thatinclusion bodies are the source of pulmonarysurfactant.  a dense osmiophilic alveolarlining layer in mammals is described.since the presence of such a layer iswell correlated with surface tension valuesand the number of inclusions, it issuggested that this layer consists of surfaceactive substances.  the difficulty indetecting such an osmiophilic layer in othermammals is thought to be, at leastin part, due to species differences in the compo-sition of materials constituting thepulmonary surfactant.  cytologic immaturityexists until lamb fetuses reach 135days gestation.  this is considered to be thebasis for the susceptibility of immaturelambs to respiratory distress.  fibrin with230 a periodicity is a component,although a small one, of hyaline membranes inlambs.  in view of the fact that maturefibrin appearing as bundles of fibrils is rare-ly found, it is suggested that the bulkof the hyaline membrane is not a mature fi-brin, but probably consists of polymersof fibrinogen and serum protein.

advances in filariasisespecially concerning periodicity of microfilariaea review is given of some advances in our knowledge about filariasis during thepast ten years.it is urged that investigations should be continued on methods to facilitatethe control of filariasis in large populations, by means ofdiethylcarbamazine--e.g. incorporation of the compound in cooking salt, aswas done with chloroquine against malaria.  furthermore, steps should be takento protect young people against filariasis by systematic treatment in theschools.in order to understand the cyclical disappearance of microfilariae from theperipheral blood and their accumulation in the lungs, the movements ofmicrofilariae in the pulmonary capillaries has been studied by cinematography.apparently their accumulation in the lungs is not due to mechanical retention,but perhaps they migrate round and round in the pre-capillary network ofarterioles.the periodicity of microfilariae is best considered as a biological rhythm.apparently the microfilariae have a circadian rhythm of their own which isentrained and synchronized by stimuli from the circadian rhythm of the host.judging by experiments with monkeys containing microfilariae of edesonfilariamalayensis, the most effective of these stimuli from the host seems to be therhythmic variation of body temperature which occurs every 24 hours.

3535. electron microscopic study of six cases of human renal amyloidosisthis study is particularly concernedwith  (a) the basal membrane in the differentstages; and (b) the intercapillary spacesin the early stages.  the conclusions maybe put as follows  (1) the amyloid substanceseems to have a fibrillar structurefrom the start.  (2) when the walls of theperipheral capillary loops are thickenedby voluminous amyloid deposits, thehyaline aspect of the primitive basal membranepersists, but its structure is altered bythe presence of multiple amyloid fibrils.(3) on the other hand, in the initial stages,amyloid fibrils cannot be seen in the'lamina densa' of the basal membrane; theyonly appear on the epithelial and endo-thelial surfaces of the membrane.  this suggeststhat amyloidosis represents anabnormal precipitate of extrinsic origin, ratherthan a transformation 'in situ'of the basal membrane.  (4) in the very early stagesof amyloid infiltration into theglomeruli the fibrillar substance is found first inthe intercapillary spaces, onlylater does it reach the peripheral capillary walls.

the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat containscharacteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures butbasically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limitingmembrane of the unit type .inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradationwhich occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . someinclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presentedsuggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involvedin the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associatedwith the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusionbodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge byaccretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolarspace . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater numberlate in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when thecuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattenedtype . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusionbodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it isconcluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active duringremodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonarysurfactant is discussed .

enzymic synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid xviii. the repair ofpartially single-stranded dna templates by dna polymerase .a partially single-stranded dna, prepared by limited digestion of eachstrand with exonuclease iii, can be restored to its native, fullydouble-stranded structure by escherichia coli dna polymerase . the rateof synthesis observed in the repair of such a partially degraded primerin the polymerase system is faster than that seen with a native dna .the newly synthesized dna is covalently attached to the primer . thefully repaired dna resembles the original native dna as judged by itsappearance in electron micrographs, cscl density-gradient analysis,denaturability and genetic activity . dna synthesis which follows therepair phase produces a structure that is not covalently linked to theprimer and resembles, in its nondenaturability, branched appearance, andlack of genetic activity, the product obtained with a native dna primer(schildkraut, richardson + kornberg, 1964) .

an electron microscopic study of developing gallbladder epithelium in the rabbitthe gall bladder epithelium of theadult rabbit consists of two types of cells.the first and more common type shows features associated with absorption,notably microvilli, limited pinocytosis, some lysosomes and an elaboration ofthe lateral cell membrane and intercellular spaces.  the mitochondria areconcentrated in a subapical band.the second and more infrequent type is a dark rod-shaped cell of unknownfunction but which may be a dehydrated epithelial cell.foetal epithelial cells lack the functional adult characteristics; the mito-chondria are uniformly distributed.  in addition they display basal granulesand apical apocrine bullae.epithelial cell damage and white cell infiltration occurs between 24 daysafter birth or just after.just before birth some epithelial cells are very large and pale with smoothoutlines, others are more dense and display vigorous pinocytosis.adult characteristics are acquired at or immediately after birth and pino-cytosis subsides.  it is believed that water resorption occurs before thefunctional changes which allow continuous passage of water into thecirculation.

(1) emigration andmigration of lymphocytes from the explant,. (2) clustering oflymphocytes around /target/ cells,. (3) ameboid transformation oflymphocytes,. (4) lymphocytic congregation,. and (5) emperipolesis .criteria for these different lymphocytic activities have been amplifiedor introduced .findings of particular interest were.. (1) the frequency of both viable and nonviable lymphocytes within the vacuoles of other cells . thisobservation is considered to be an absolute criterion for the recogni-tion of emperipolesis . a subsequent /inclusionbody/ appearance of thedead lymphocytes has been observed . (2) the intimate relationship ofameboid forms of lymphocytes to selected cells, resulting in ajuxtanuclear and frequently unipolar crowding of one cell by numerouslymphocytes while nearby cells were totally devoid of ameboidlymphocytes . reasons are given to support the impression that thisphenomenon is re lated to sensitization . there is also the possibilitythat the phenomenon may indicate that the lymphocyte is /conditioned/ .(3) the apparent entry of the lymphocyte into the cell has been recordedby timelapse cinematography .a lymphocyte relationship to cancer cells was infrequently foundalthough explants of 15 of the 20 cases produced identifiable cancercells and lymphocytes emigrated from the explants of all 20 cases . itis not apparent from this limited study whether this is a significantfinding .

fetal and neonatal hepatitis and its consequences.the author reports on 18 fatal cases observedin infants from 3 weeks to 1 year old.in all cases, jaundice appeared just after birthor during the first days of life, andwas persistent.  the stools were sometimesdiscolored.  there was no blood incompatibility.the picture was similar to thatof congenital biliary atresia.  pathologicalstudy revealed 2 groups: (1) with pathologicalchanges of hepatitis (11 cases).the liver is enlarged, flabby and icteric.  microscopyshows dissociation of the cellcords and polymorphism of the hepatic cells(necrotic cells, balloon cells, giant celltransformation).  some of the giant cells showvacuoles, erythrocytes, lipids andacidophilic material in their cytoplasm.  thereare signs of regeneration, collapseof the stromal framework, proliferation of themesenchymal cells and bile retention.cells of the erythrocytic series are scatteredin the periportal spaces with eosinophilicleucocytes, lymphocytes and histiocytes.(2) with fibrosis and cirrhosis (7cases).  the liver is green, firm, with a nodularor granular surface.  the extra-hepaticbiliary tree is normal.  the spleen isenlarged.  microscopy shows bile stasis,pericholangiolitic fibrosis, and proliferationof bile ductules.  the periportal, interlobularand intralobular fibrous tissue is increased,and shows cellular infiltrations.the architecture of the liver is disturbed bythe presence of pseudolobuli in the regenerationareas.  it is suggested that these casesare due to a congenital viral hepatitis,which is not only the result of an intrauterineinfection, but also a feature offetal hepatitis, with secondary pericholangioliticor post-necrotic liver cirrhosis.the neonatal giant cell hepatitis is to be consideredas the result of a cytotoxic actionof the virus.  the author considers alsothe possibility of a viral etiology incases of biliary atresia on the basis of theirmorphological similarity with congenitalviral hepatitis.

pulmonary vascular plexiform lesion pathogenetic studies .an attempt was made to test the theory that in pulmonary arterialhypertension, the plexiform lesion is a jet lesion beyond points ofarterial stenosis resulting from nonspecific intimal thickening .in 39 subjects with such congenital communications as are associatedwith pulmonary arterial hypertension, the lungs were studiedhistologically . in each, there was an additional element of pulmonaryvenous obstruction . it is likely that in the absence of pulmonaryvenous obstruction, adult patients with only the congenitalcommunication would have developed plexiform lesions .in the three adult patients in the study, no plexiform lesions wereidentified . among the 36 infants or children, one subject showedplexiform lesions, a 53-day-old girl with mitral atresia, ventricularseptal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus .while the findings in the three adult subjects support the theoryregarding the genesis of plexiform lesions, the findings in the oneinfant with plexiform lesions appear to contradict it .

2803. effect of dosage on endotoxin-induced changes in the reticuloendothelialsystem of rabbitstissues were removed from rabbits 4and 24 hr. following an i.v. injection of 5,25, or 200 ug of endotoxin.  explants oftissues from normal and injected animalswere grown in a coagulated plasma mediumand in medium containing 1 ug/ml ofendotoxin.  the migration and growth of cellswere observed during the following weekof incubation.  the inhibition or stimulationof cells of the reticuloendothelial system(res) at different host sites after endotoxinadministration depended on the dosageand on the known capacity of different organsto take up circulating endotoxin.  macro-phage migration was suppressed in culturesof spleen removed 4 hr. after a dose ofhibited by 200 ug, but macrophages inlymph node, testis, and thymus showed an in-crease in numbers, in extent of migrationand in phagocytic activity.  widespreadres stimulation was seen in tissues removed24 hr after the largest dose.  in ad-dition to the restoration of re cell activity inspleen and lung there was a markedincrease in the migration of large phagocyticcells from bone marrow, as well asother organs.  macrophages from endotoxin-injectedanimals were as sensitive asnormal macrophages to added endotoxin in vitro.

2406. profound hypothermiathe aim of hypothermia is protection of vitalcerebral structures from hypoxiaduring aneurysm repair; profound hypothermiais also valuable in operating oncertain cardiac defects which cannot be repairedeven with whole body perfusion.since the time needed for aneurysm repair oftenexceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12minutes without circulation afforded by surfacehypothermia of 29  to 30  c., theauthors have investigated the drew (open-chest)technic, the closed-chest method,and isolated cerebral perfusion.  the drew technicconsists of substituting twopumps for the heart while the patient's lungs actas the oxygenator.  because of itsdisadvantages (the large amounts of blood neededand the morbidity due to intra-cardiac cannulation and median sternotomy), aclosed-chest method was developed,using a mayo-gibbons vertical-sheet pump-oxygenatorto provide the perfusion andextracorporeal cooling without requiring thoracotomy.in cerebral perfusion, bloodis taken from one artery, pumped through a heatexchanger, and returned to anotherartery.  the authors describe anesthetic technics,offer comparisons of the threemethods, give instructions pertaining to the productionof hypothermia, and list theproblems encountered in the management of these cases.

1835. the decrease of the steroids in the urine in the course of lung tb.(the therapeutic value of their increase after calciferol)quantitative determination of the urinarysteroids in 38 patients with extensive ul-cero-caseous pulmonary tb confirmedthat the 17-ketosteroids are always decreasedin these cases.  calciferol, in the formof one ampoule of vit.  d2 of 600,000 u.every 10 days, in combination with activetuberculostatic drugs, in the majority ofthe cases leads to an increase of theurinary 17-ketosteroids from 50 to 100% in 2mth.  it appears that the calciferolexerts its action through proteolysis; it stimulatesthe liquefaction and evacuation of thecaseous material.  this proteolytic effect isrelated to that of the mineralocorticoids,which are phlogistic and proteolytic sub-stances.  calciferol offers the advantageover these substances that it does not affectthe electrolytes and is well tolerated bythe organism.  for this reason, good resultsmay be expected from its administrationin cases of extensive pulmonary tb, inwhich the myc. tuberculosis has remainedsensitive to the administered tuberculosticdrugs but nevertheless does not proceedtowards recovery because of the marked caseouslesions.  in such cases calciferol treatmentleads to a rapid and pronounced decreaseof the radiological shadows, improves thegeneral condition and also modifies thesteroid metabolism rendered abnormal by the disease.

2379. in-vitro culture of pulmonary tumors in hamsters caused by adenovirus 12it is known that the adenoviruses 12 and18 provoke malignant tumors in thenew-born hamster.  the authors made a studyof the histogenesis of these tumors andexamined the specific changes brought aboutin the cells by the virus infectionmalignancy, presence of viral antigen, reactionsto superinfection.  when new-bornhamsters were inoculated in the chest withadenovirus 12, malignant tumorsdeveloped in one or two months, in 16 animalsout of 22.  these tumors presentedan epithelial aspect and were of bronchiolo-alveolarorigin.  they were transplant-able in vivo; if they were cultured in vitro,they consisted in the first few cultures ofmacrophages, fibroblasts and epithelium.in subsequent passages, there was aprogressive disappearance of the macrophagesand fibroblasts.  in some cases, theculture after seven passages was of a purelyepithelial nature, and when it wasreimplanted into hamsters at this time itgave rise to the rapid development of anepithelial tumor.  in the tumor cultures,no adenovirus could be demonstrated.nor could cultures of the pulmonary tumors,or cultures of normal hamster lung beinfected with adenovirus.  it appears that thelung of the hamster in an organotyp-ical culture constitutes a means of choicefor the malignant transformation ofadenovirus 12.

serological relationships among human mycoplasmas as shownby complement-fixation and gel diffusionand robert m. chanockantigenic relationships among humanmycoplasmas were studied by complement-fixation and agar gel diffusion techniques.  fourrecognized human species.  mycoplasma hoministype 1, m. hominis type 2, m. salivarium, andm. fermentans were antigenically distinct inthese tests.  in addition, m. pneumoniae (eatonagent, the etiological agent of cold agglutinin-positive atypical pneumonia) was different fromthese four species.  although these species weredistinct, evidence of shared antigenic componentswas obtained in complement-fixation and agargel diffusion tests.  since rabbits were immunizedwith mycoplasmas grown in rabbit muscle infu-sion broth supplemented with rabbit serum or,in the case of m. pneumoniae, with infected chickembryo lung suspension, the possibility that theheterologous reactions resulted from antibodyto growth medium components could be excluded.four recent mycoplasma isolates from the oro-pharynx were analyzed, and three were shown tobe closely related to m. hominis type 1, and thefourth was closely related to m. salivarium.although the recent isolates could not be dis-tinguished from the related "prototype" humanspecies by complement-fixation, differences couldbe detected by the agar gel diffusion technique.

2701. the role of certain additional factors in the development of amyloidosis,and its prophylaxis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)in patients with chronic fibrocavernoustuberculosis of the lungs, any toxic-aller-gic side reactions to antibacterial therapy,chronic foci or infection and diseaseswith an allergic component can contributeto the development of amyloidosis.  theearly detection and clearing of chronicfoci of infection and effective measuresagainst even mildly pronounced toxic-allergicside reactions are of prime impor-tance in the prevention of amyloidosis.  theunsystematic and prolonged administra-tion of antibacterial preparations, along withtheir toxic side effects, tends to in-crease the incidence of amyloidosis in patientswith chronic fibrocavernous pulmon-ary tb.  individual constitutional factors areof great importance in the developmentof side effects.  side reactions to chemopreparations,in cases of hypofunction ofthe liver and kidneys and autonomicdysfunction promote the development of dys-trophic processes, as is confirmedby the high frequency of toxic-allergic reac-tions in patients with fibrocavernouspulmonary tb who later develop amyloidosis.the administration of desensitizing drugsto patients showing side reactions there-fore helps to prevent amyloidosis in casesof chronic fibrocavernous tb, and chemo-therapy should be automatically combinedwith the administration of desensitizingand stimulatory drugs in this class of case.

2317. the use of needle biopsy of the liver in the diagnosis of visceralamyloidosis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)the results of 86 puncture biopsies of theliver in 84 patients with pulmonary tuber-culosis (55 men and 31 women aged from18 to 73 yr.) for the purpose of diagnosingamyloidosis are reported.  puncture wasperformed when amyloidosis was suspectedon the basis of the case history (destructiveprocess of more than 2-3 years' duration),clinical signs in the form of enlargement ofthe liver and spleen, edema, changesin the blood picture and blood protein formula,and changes in the urine (proteinuria,cylindruria, isohyposthenuria).  amyloidosiswas diagnosed or its presence surmisedbefore puncture in 23 patients; the puncturebiopsy confirmed the diagnosis in 14and refuted it in 9 of them.  in 8 patients withoutclinical symptoms, amyloidosiswas diagnosed on the basis of the puncture biopsyalone.  in 9 cases with fatal out-come, the post-mortem findings coincided withthe results of the bioptic puncture.of the 62 patients in whom amyloidosis was notdetected by biopsy, 31 had moderatedystrophic changes and 9 had marked dystrophicchanges while in 22 cases no patho-logical changes were found; 6 of these patientslater developed amyloidosis.  thesefindings supported the contention that liveramyloidosis is linked with dystrophicchanges in the epithelial cells.  markeddystrophic changes can precede amyloidosisor may occur simultaneously with it.  moderatedystrophic changes are quite commonin patients with an exacerbating tuberculousprocess in the lungs.  the wide applica-tion of bioptic puncture of the liver in indicatedcases can increase our knowledgeof the morphological changes taking place in theliver in tb.

measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorptionspectrometry .an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitatesquantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, includingurine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins .the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorptionspectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit directmeasurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary toemploy a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate thenickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry .the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine andhuman b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . therecovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a rangefrom 94 to 97, and the recovery of nickel added to human b-globulinaveraged 101 per cent, with a range from 96 to 104 .the mean concentration of nickel in 24-hr. collections of urine from17 normal subjects was 1.8 ug. per 100 ml. (s.d. = 0.8), with a rangefrom 0.4 to 3.1 . the mean urinary excretion of nickel was 19.8 ug. per24 hr. (s.d. = 10.0), with a range from 7.2 to 37.6 .the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleicacids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the meanconcentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugalsupernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. ofrna, with a range from 21 to 39 .measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serumproteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and bycold-ethanol precipitation . the highest concentrations of nickel werefound in preparations of serum b-globulins .

2542. symposium on the fine structure and replication of bacteria and theirparts. ii. bacterial cytoplasmcomparison of the fine structure of thecytoplasm of the bacterial cell with that ofthe 'cell in general' reveals importantdifferences leading to the conclusion that, inthe bacterial cytoplasm, there is littledifferentiation into separate functional en-tities.  there is no nuclear membrane, andfine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo-plasm into the cytoplasm where they mayexpand in all directions.  the cytoplasm is notnecessarily intersected by membranousprofiles of special configuration, as is borneout by e. coli b and other gram-negativeorganisms.  when membranous profilesof special configuration are present, asin the gram-positive b. subtilis, thesedo not appear differentiated into clearlydefinable endoplasmic reticulum, golgisubstance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria.as for kinetosomes, the presenceof centrioles is perhaps not very likely.  theexperiments in which tellurite is re-duced in the cells suggest that there arestructures at the base of the flagella withreductive capacity.  however, upon applicationof the tetranitro-blue tetrazoliumtechnic to b. subtilis, these are not stained.they are presumably identical withbasal granules.  the membranous structuresin b. subtilis are called chondrioidsby the author because probably one of theirfunctions is that they are the sites ofthe respiratory enzyme chain.  in thegram-negative p. vulgaris, the probable siteof the respiratory chain has a structurevery different from that in the bacillus; itis not clear whether membranes areinvolved in their structure.  morphologically,even in b. subtilis chondrioids differfundamentally from the mitochondria in thatthey are not built up from compositemembranes, they are extensions of the plasmamembrane, and they may not be completelyclosed systems.  regarding this lastpoint, it was observed that chondrioids maypossibly stand in open connection withthe cell's environment, since its lumen is notseparated from the cell wall by aplasma membrane.  although as yet nothing isknown about this, it does not seem tobe precluded that these membranous organellesmay function also as intracellulartransport systems.  contrary to porter's ideasabout er, the chondrioids are notextensions of a nuclear envelope, but of theplasma membrane.  on the other hand,they are in the nuclear area, in direct contactwith the nucleoplasm, and therefore,perhaps, they need not carry in their interiorsome dna, as is now becoming knownfor ordinary mitochondria.  the chromatophorevesicle is of a simple structure andin connection with the plasma membrane.  it iscovered by a single membrane andthus resembles the granum disc, but it is muchsmaller.  in tissue cells, an im-portant function of the er is the support of proteinsynthesis by ribosomes boundto their surfaces.  evidence is now accumulatingthat the active complexes for poly-peptide synthesis in bacteria are also membrane-boundand are series of 70s ribo-somes using the same messenger rna molecule.it remains a contradictory situ-ation that the particles obtained here through releaseof cytoplasm from protoplastsin diluted, rather crude fixing media, and identifiedas ribosomes, could not berecognized as such in thin sections of the ryter-kellenbergerfixed protoplasts.this point is much in need of clarification.  buteven if the cytoplasm in the thinsections of the protoplasts is in a state ofdispersion brought about artificially, itis still apparent from the various micrographsthat basically the cytoplasm is anetwork of presumably linear arrays, with manyinterconnections due to fibrillarsystems.  fibrils from the nucleoplasm penetratedeeply into the cytoplasm.  thepresence of fine fibrils of various thicknesses,electron densities, and orientationsmakes high-resolution study of the cytoplasmicdetails an intriguing prospect fromwhich much fundamental information can begained.  the organizational pattern onthe ultrastructural level in bacteria revealsfundamental similarities and divergen-cies from that in the 'cell in general'.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero andin vitro with rubella virus.a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomeswas undertaken to determine if damageto the genetic apparatus of human cells maybe induced by rubella virus and whethersuch damage produces the pathology seenin newborns from mothers infected earlyin pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains wereinitiated in vitro from embryonic materialobtained by therapeutic abortion of fetusesfrom rubella-infected mothers.  embryonicmaterial from spontaneous and non-rubellatherapeutic abortions yielded similarcell strains for infection in vitro.  theresults from both types of studies were asfollows: (a) virus shedding cell strains wereobtained from all types of organs cultivated,which indicated wide disseminationof virus in the fetuses from rubella-infectedmothers.  (b) chronic infection couldreadily be established by in vitro infectionand no cytopathic effect was noted.(c) although many strains continued to shedvirus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,no changes in growth propertiesoccurred with the exception that infectedstrains from lung tissue showed limitedgrowth capacities.  (d) from observationsof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obviouschromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctionalchanges were observed instrains infected naturally or experimentally.(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derivedcell strains there was a marked elevationin frequency of chromosome breakage in3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlationbetween virus shedding in vitro andincreased chromosome breakage was notedalthough this was not complete.  (g) thecombined average frequency of chromosomebreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortionstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortusstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,but significant elevation in average chromosomebreak frequency (9.8%) was obtainedin four cell strains which had been experimentallyinfected in vitro with rubella virus(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effectsupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,these were restricted to slight general elevationsin frequency of breakage abovenormal values.  very high increases in breakswere sporadic.  it appears more likelythat the general fetal abnormalities associatedwith rubella infection in vivo resultfrom possible effects of the virus upon growthrather than from effects upon thechromosomes.  however, the studies wererestricted to fibroblasts cultured invitro; and effects on other types of cellsmay have greater implications for thisquestion.
