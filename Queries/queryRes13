characterization of bacillus subtilis bacteriophages .brodetsky, anna m. (university of california, los angeles), and w. r.romig . characterization of bacillus subtilis bacteriophages . j.bacteriol. 90..1655-1663. 1965.--a group of six phages, sp5, sp6, sp7,sp8, sp9, and sp13, which use the marburg strain of bacillus subtilis ashost was characterized . these phages, referred to as group 1, wereexamined for the following properties.. host range, plaque morphology,stability, adsorption kinetics, one-step growth characteristics, calciumrequirements, serum neutralization, thermal inactivation, andinactivation by ultraviolet irradiation . five unrelated b. subtilisphages, sp3, sp10, pbs1, sp alpha, and sp beta, were included in thestudies . when first isolated, none of the group 1 phages was able toreplicate efficiently on b. subtilis sb19, a mutant of the /transforming/ b. subtilis 168 . host range mutants capable of growth in sb19 wereisolated for all of the group 1 phages except sp13, and are designatedthe /star/ phages (sp5 through sp9 ) . for characterization, sb19 wasused as host for the star phages, and another b. subtilis mutant, 168b,was host for sp13 .

comparison of ultraviolet sensitivity of bacillus subtilis bacteriophagespo2 and its infectious dna .deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from a clear plaque mutant of thetemperate phage, spo2, was infectious when incubated with competentcultures of bacillus subtilis 168 m . the relationship between numbersof infectious centers and dna concentration was linear .the sensitivity of the infectious dna to ultraviolet light was muchgreater than that of the free phage when b. subtilis 168 m was used ashost . acriflavin, which inhibits host cell reactivation, increased therate of ultraviolet inactivation of the free phage so that it approachedthe inactivation rate of the phage dna . acriflavin had little effect onthe survival curves of the infectious dna .non-host reactivating mutants (hcr ) of b. subtilis 168 m wereisolated . the survival curves of spo2 phage were much steeper when thehcr mutant was used as a host than those obtained when the hcr parentalstrain was used as a host .ultraviolet sensitivity of the phage dna was still greater than thatof the free phage even when b. subtilis hcr was used as host, but thedifference in sensitivity was much less than the difference obtainedwith b. subtilis hcr as a host .possible explanations for the greater ultraviolet sensitivity of theinfectious dna are discussed .

infectivity of dna isolated from bacillus subtilis bacteriophage, sp82 .sp82, a newly isolated bacteriophage of bacillus subtilis, isdescribed . sp82 is closely related to sp8, but differs from sp8 in thedensity of its denatured dna and in its plating effciency on b. subtilisstrain sb-1 .dna isolated from this phage can be recovered in molecular weightequivalent to the amount contained in a single phage (approximately 130x 10 daltons) . dna of this molecular weight, but not half pieces, isinfective in competent b. subtilis . the response of plaque-formingability to dna concentration suggests that four whole molecules arerequired to initiate an infective center . recombination studies withmixed dna's of two non-allelic temperature-sensitive mutants confirm theexistence of an obligatory co-operative infective process . a secondinfective procedure that utilizes extracted phage dna is described . inthis system, low concentrations of wild-type dna are exposed to thecells . at these concentrations the multiple-event nature of phage dnainfection precludes the formation of unaided plaques . however, bysubsequently superinfecting the dna-infected cells with atemperature-sensitive mutant and plating under selective conditions,genetic rescue of the infecting dna is accomplished and detected .infective centers elicited by this /marker rescue/ phenomenon aredirectly proportional to dna concentration . the time of attainment ofdnase resistance by phage dna infective centers that have irreversiblyadsorbed dna can be measured . phage dna infective centers require atleast 13 minutes to become totally dnase resistant . the reasons for thefailure of single phage dna molecules to carry out an infection arediscussed in terms of a specific breakage-reunion

the carrier state of bacillus subtilis infected with the transducingbacteriophage sp10 .bacteriophage sp10 may infect bacillus subtilis to form a carriersystem . the infected bacteria give rise to infected organisms after sixor more successive single-colony isolations . about 60 of the sporesderived from such an infected culture yield clones that produce phage,and such spores retain their ability to produce phage even aftertreatment with antiserum and heating at 80 . four hours' incubation ofcarrier spores in nutrient broth yields cultures having more than 10infective centers per bacterium . cultivation of infected organisms inmedium containing sp10 antiserum leads to loss of phage and loss ofimmunity to phage infection . dna with a density characteristic of viraldna can be detected in infected bacteria . extracts of infected bacteriacontain a phage-induced deoxyribonuclease activity which attacks bothphage and bacterial dna in vitro . the phage-bacterial complex istherefore best described as a carrier state .the dna of the phage and of b. subtilis are chemically different .enzymatically prepared complementary virus rna has no homology withbacterial dna . the lack of homology of this transducing phage dna withthe dna of its host and the failure to form a truly lysogenicrelationship reinforce previous conclusions that transducing bacterialdna is incorporated into the sp10 virus particle without anyrecombination between viral and bacterial dna .

on the mechanism of genetic recombination in transforming bacillussubtilis .the molecular fate of transforming dna in competent bacillus subtilishas been studied . the physical differentiation of transforming dna andthe genetic material of recipient bacteria was effected by employing theisotopes n and p . competent bacteria labeled with n and p were allowedto incorporate n p-labeled transforming dna intracellularly . dna wasisolated from these recipient cells and centrifuged in cesium chloride .analysis of drop fractions collected at equilibrium showed the presenceof radioactivity in a region of density corresponding to recipient dna .material contribution from donor dna to the resident dna did not occurwhen genetically inert bacillus cereus dna was substituted forhomologous dna . it was concluded that radioactivity appearing in theunlabeled resident dna was not the result of degradation of input (p)dna and subsequent incorporation by normal metabolic processes . sincesingle-stranded dna of donor origin was not detected, nor was thereevidence for the non-specific aggregation of donor and recipient dna, itwas concluded that the observed physical association of transforming andrecipient dna occurs as a result of genetic recombination in transformedb. subtilis .

comparison of mutation and inactivation rates induced in bacteriophageand transforming dna by various mutagens .inactivation and mutation rates were measured for t4 phages andbacillus subtilis transforming dna treated by low ph, nitrous acid, orhydroxylamine at different temperatures . the frequency of mutantsincreased linearly with time for all three agents, whereas the logarithmof survival gave a linear plot only for nitrous acid and low ph . anarrhenius plot showed the same slopes for both inactivation and mutationrates after treatment with low ph or nitrous acid,. for the latter agentthe slope remained unaltered even when the dna was treated in thedenaturated state . in contrast, mutation rates obtained after theexposure to hydroxylamine differed greatly for native or denatured dna,phage t4 being intermediate .treatment by low ph or nitrous acid interrupted the genetic linkagebetween tryptophan and histidine, the interrupting hits being about 1/3as frequent as lethal hits, independent of the temperature .

906. molecular mechanism of genetic recombination in bacterial transformationthe mechanism of dna incorporation intothe recipient cell chromosome was in-vestigated in a b. subtilis transformationsystem.  the recipient cells were auxo-trophic for 2 linked markers.  hybrid dnaused for transformation was heterozy-gous for one of these markers.  no differencesin transformation activity were foundwhen the effect of native and hybrid dna wascompared.  according to the authorsthis observation is easily explained if we acceptthat each of both complementarystrands of the donor dna can be incorporatedinto the recipient chromosome withequal probability.  the results on the segregationof genetic characters in the pro-geny of transformed cells are also consistentwith the model of independent incorpo-ration of both dna strands.  some calculationswere done on the probability of theintegration of a single dna strand carrying aparticular genetic marker, and on theprobability of recombination leading to double transformants.

438. lag period characterizing the entry of transforming deoxyribonucleic acidinto bacillus subtilisthe kinetics of appearance of transformantsas a function of time of exposure todna has been studied.  a short lag periodof approximately 1 min at 37 c is evi-dent when the transformation is terminatedwith deoxyribonuclease.  the length ofthis lag is independent of the genetic traittransferred.  moreover, the lag is unaf-fected by transforming dna concentration,by the presence of homologous unmarkeddna, and by shearing and cross-linking ofthe transforming dna.  the lag showsa strong inverse temperature dependence.the energy of activation is 13.9 kcal.the lag is abolished when the transformationis terminated by washing instead ofby addition of deoxyribonuclease.  these resultsare taken to indicate an immediateadsorption of dna to cells, followed by adeoxyribonuclease-sensitive period of1 min, during which time the genetic traitis entering the cell.  these results makefeasible an investigation of the configurationassumed by the dna molecule duringentry into the cell.

1362. the synthesis of phage and host dna in the establishment of lysogenya method of extraction is described whichprevents excessive fragmentation of bac-terial dna.  the larger bacterial dna canthen be separated from the phage dnaon sucrose gradients.  the relative amountsof phage and host dna made at varioustimes during infection of s. typhimuriumwith phage p22 leading to lysogeny havebeen determined.  phage-specific dnasynthesis begins at about 4 min, continuesto increase for 2-4 min, and then decreasesuntil complete repression is attainedat 16 min.  autonomous phage dna synthesisremains repressed from then on.  bac-teria-specific synthesis proceeds at adecreasing rate until about 16 min, whenalmost complete inhibition is reached.when dna synthesis recovers in the in-fected cells, only host-specific materialis made.  a new species of dna, which ismade only when phage dna is synthesized,has been detected.  the possible implica-tions of these findings in the understandingof the lysogenic interaction is discussed.

1361. the mechanism of histidase induction and formation in bacillus subtilisthe role of the inducer, l-histidine, in thesynthesis of histidase (l-histidine am-monia lyase) in b. subtilis was investigated.it was found that induced cells poisonedwith actinomycin, an inhibitor of rna synthesis,lose their capacity for the forma-tion of a protein precursor of histidase at a ratewhich is independent of the presenceor absence of the inducer.  these results showthat the inducer does not increasethe intracellular level of histidase-specificmessenger rna by preventing the des-truction of the major portion of this material,the fraction that is engaged in pro-tein synthesis.  the possibility has not beenexcluded that the inducer exerts itseffect by bringing about the stabilization ofthe messenger rna that is still attachedto dna or has not yet become attached toribosomes.  alternatively, the inducer mayactually stimulate the synthesis ofhistidase-specific messenger rna.  the conver-sion of the precursor to active enzymeappears to involve polymerization of mono-mers, rather than the release ofribosome-bound inactive enzyme.

2542. symposium on the fine structure and replication of bacteria and theirparts. ii. bacterial cytoplasmcomparison of the fine structure of thecytoplasm of the bacterial cell with that ofthe 'cell in general' reveals importantdifferences leading to the conclusion that, inthe bacterial cytoplasm, there is littledifferentiation into separate functional en-tities.  there is no nuclear membrane, andfine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo-plasm into the cytoplasm where they mayexpand in all directions.  the cytoplasm is notnecessarily intersected by membranousprofiles of special configuration, as is borneout by e. coli b and other gram-negativeorganisms.  when membranous profilesof special configuration are present, asin the gram-positive b. subtilis, thesedo not appear differentiated into clearlydefinable endoplasmic reticulum, golgisubstance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria.as for kinetosomes, the presenceof centrioles is perhaps not very likely.  theexperiments in which tellurite is re-duced in the cells suggest that there arestructures at the base of the flagella withreductive capacity.  however, upon applicationof the tetranitro-blue tetrazoliumtechnic to b. subtilis, these are not stained.they are presumably identical withbasal granules.  the membranous structuresin b. subtilis are called chondrioidsby the author because probably one of theirfunctions is that they are the sites ofthe respiratory enzyme chain.  in thegram-negative p. vulgaris, the probable siteof the respiratory chain has a structurevery different from that in the bacillus; itis not clear whether membranes areinvolved in their structure.  morphologically,even in b. subtilis chondrioids differfundamentally from the mitochondria in thatthey are not built up from compositemembranes, they are extensions of the plasmamembrane, and they may not be completelyclosed systems.  regarding this lastpoint, it was observed that chondrioids maypossibly stand in open connection withthe cell's environment, since its lumen is notseparated from the cell wall by aplasma membrane.  although as yet nothing isknown about this, it does not seem tobe precluded that these membranous organellesmay function also as intracellulartransport systems.  contrary to porter's ideasabout er, the chondrioids are notextensions of a nuclear envelope, but of theplasma membrane.  on the other hand,they are in the nuclear area, in direct contactwith the nucleoplasm, and therefore,perhaps, they need not carry in their interiorsome dna, as is now becoming knownfor ordinary mitochondria.  the chromatophorevesicle is of a simple structure andin connection with the plasma membrane.  it iscovered by a single membrane andthus resembles the granum disc, but it is muchsmaller.  in tissue cells, an im-portant function of the er is the support of proteinsynthesis by ribosomes boundto their surfaces.  evidence is now accumulatingthat the active complexes for poly-peptide synthesis in bacteria are also membrane-boundand are series of 70s ribo-somes using the same messenger rna molecule.it remains a contradictory situ-ation that the particles obtained here through releaseof cytoplasm from protoplastsin diluted, rather crude fixing media, and identifiedas ribosomes, could not berecognized as such in thin sections of the ryter-kellenbergerfixed protoplasts.this point is much in need of clarification.  buteven if the cytoplasm in the thinsections of the protoplasts is in a state ofdispersion brought about artificially, itis still apparent from the various micrographsthat basically the cytoplasm is anetwork of presumably linear arrays, with manyinterconnections due to fibrillarsystems.  fibrils from the nucleoplasm penetratedeeply into the cytoplasm.  thepresence of fine fibrils of various thicknesses,electron densities, and orientationsmakes high-resolution study of the cytoplasmicdetails an intriguing prospect fromwhich much fundamental information can begained.  the organizational pattern onthe ultrastructural level in bacteria revealsfundamental similarities and divergen-cies from that in the 'cell in general'.

lesions of the liver in hereditarymetabolic diseaseswhether the various cells of the liver, both parenchymal and stromal,receive genetic misinformation in all hereditary diseases caused by genemutation is unknown, but the metabolic capabilities of these several celltypes are so diverse that it is not surprising that their involvement inmany such diseases can be demonstrated by clinical, pathological, or bio-chemical methods.  repetitive abnormality of the liver has apparently notbeen defined for any disease caused by quantitative (i.e., chromosomal)gene anomaly, whether produced by nondisjunction, translocation, ormajor deletion, perhaps because relatively few such diseases have beendescribed.  as a result, the genetically determined disorders of the liversurveyed in this paper appear to be the result of conventional "singlegene" abnormalities, and to be transmitted in affected families by men-delian mechanisms.

twins discordantfor early infantile autisma pair of heterozygous twins discordantfor early infantile autism is reported and therelevant literature reviewed.  although mani-fest organic factors were ruled out, the twins'physical development was different.  a spe-cific emotional etiology was not demon-strated.  the few available twin studies offerfindings consistent with the hypothesis thatgenetic factors are relevant to the develop-ment of childhood autism.  evidence is alsopresented that impaired acquisition of lan-guage may have hereditary determinants.a second set of probably homozygoustwins are reported who were also discordantfor autism.  this second case suggests that,although genetic factors may play a part, insome cases the syndrome of infantile autismappears to be a reversible one.  in view ofthis set of twins and of kanner's sibling data,the role of genetic factors remains obscure,and more twin studies properly documentedwith blood typing are needed.

immunological demonstration of factor viii protein in the plasma ofhemophiliacs and its value for an insight into hemophilia a.by immunization of rabbits one obtains antiseraagainst human factor viii, the actionof the immunsera has been determined usinga modification of the thromboplastingenerationstest (the factor viii neutralizationtest).  the antibodies against factor viiiare equally absorbed by either normal or hemophiliaa plasma.  this observation showsthat hemophilia a plasma contains as much factorviii protein as normal plasma does.in normal and hemophilia a serum one findsat a lower level similar concentrations offactor viii.  in analogy with cross-reacting substances(crm) in bacteria mutants anhypothesis has been made according to whichthe authors are dealing with the productof a genetically altered synthesis of factor viii.this product is functionally less activebut possesses the same antigenic determinantsas the normal factor viii.  some inhibitorproperties of the hemophilia plasma can beexplained by competitive inhibition madepossible by the similarity of structure.  the factthat the inhibitor discovered by mammenand factor viii have similar properties supportthe hypothesis.  the theory of someauthors according to which the plasma of anhemophiliac a contains normal amountsof a normal factor viii blocked by a specificinhibitor, the pathogenetic agent of hemophilia ais rejected because of genetic considerationsand because the accelerator appearingafter ether treatment of hemophilia a plasma isnot identical with factor viii.

congenital malformations of c.n.s.it seems that only a small proportion of malformations ofthe central nervous system can be explained in simple geneticalterms and that most are dependent, to some extent at least,on environmental factors.  the nature of these has yet to bedetermined.  dr. williamson found that the maternal aunts,uncles, and cousins of her index cases of anencephalus andspina bifida were more frequently affected than the paternalrelatives were.  she suggested that mothers of affectedchildren had some genetic factor which modifies the intra-uterine environment and thus predisposes the embryo to thesemalformations.  such a hypothesis opens up interestingpossibilities, but before accepting it one would have to besatisfied that the higher incidence in maternal relatives isnot merely due to the fact that the history is obtained inmost cases from the mother.

2564. chemical inactivation and reactivation of transforming dna (russian)the kinetics of the inactivation of linkedand unlinked genetic markers by meansof hno2 or uv light was studied.  closelylinked markers are inactivated simul-taneously, unlinked markers are inactivatedindependently.  it seems that thechemical attack on dna impairs a large partof macromolecule, including manycistrons.  it was shown by genetic experimentsthat chemical inactivation prac-tically does not influence the process of dnainclusion into competent cells.  bymeans of viscosity measurements it wasshown that the molecular weight andmacromolecular properties of dna do notsignificantly change during chemicalinactivation by means of hno2.  two explanationsfor the inactivation of trans-forming activity of dna are discussed  (1) structuraldeteriorations, preventingintegration of dna molecule into the genome ofrecipient cell, or (2) deletion ofa chain unit out of dna chain resulting in wrongreading of code triplets.  it waspreviously described in the literature that extensiveinactivation leads to a stateof dna, apparently more resistant than the initial one.inactivation does not con-firm to exponential kinetics.  the authors discuss thecoding mistake hypothesisas an explanation for this remarkable fact.  extensivehno2 or uv light action re-sults in multiple lesions in the dna molecule andleads to reactivation becausethe deletions restore correct reading of the codein a large part of dna molecule.on the basis of this explanation reactivation ofchemically injured dna by meansof fusion and annealing with homologous butgenetically inactive dna, or by slightfragmentation of dna by means of ultrasonicvibrations may be expected.  attemptsto achieve reactivation by both methods gavepositive results.

growth hormone and diabetes mellitussince the advent of insulin the vascular and neurologicallesions have replaced ketoacidosis as the majorproblem in diabetes.  although good control of hyperglycemiaand glycosuria with diet and insulin mayinfluence favorably the development of the ocular angiopathy,there remains a high incidence of theselesions with resulting blindness despite such goodcontrol.growth hormone may be a major factor in thepathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and its effectsmay be a reflection of the genetic disturbance.  its importancewas first realized by the classical experimentsof houssay and those of young which revealed itsdiabetogenic effects in experimental animals.  the associationof acromegaly with diabetes has been for along time the major argument in support of the hypothesisof the diabetogenic effect of growth hormonein man.

2803. effect of dosage on endotoxin-induced changes in the reticuloendothelialsystem of rabbitstissues were removed from rabbits 4and 24 hr. following an i.v. injection of 5,25, or 200 ug of endotoxin.  explants oftissues from normal and injected animalswere grown in a coagulated plasma mediumand in medium containing 1 ug/ml ofendotoxin.  the migration and growth of cellswere observed during the following weekof incubation.  the inhibition or stimulationof cells of the reticuloendothelial system(res) at different host sites after endotoxinadministration depended on the dosageand on the known capacity of different organsto take up circulating endotoxin.  macro-phage migration was suppressed in culturesof spleen removed 4 hr. after a dose ofhibited by 200 ug, but macrophages inlymph node, testis, and thymus showed an in-crease in numbers, in extent of migrationand in phagocytic activity.  widespreadres stimulation was seen in tissues removed24 hr after the largest dose.  in ad-dition to the restoration of re cell activity inspleen and lung there was a markedincrease in the migration of large phagocyticcells from bone marrow, as well asother organs.  macrophages from endotoxin-injectedanimals were as sensitive asnormal macrophages to added endotoxin in vitro.

a genetic study of neonatal obstructive jaundice58 children with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 7 with intrahepaticbiliary atresia and 50 with 'neonatal hepatitis' were analysedconcerning diagnostic criteria, natural history, familial, clinicaland pathological data.  in extrahepatic biliary atresia, there is noevidence of a familial tendency, influence of maternal age, birthorder or disturbance of foetal development.  in 'neonatal hepatitis',there were 4 consanguineous parents, suggesting a mutantautosomal gene in homozygous form.  some infants with the genotypefor 'neonatal hepatitis' may manifest a very mild or a very severeform, so, a diagnosis was not made.  an apparent excess of malesover females may be another evidence of failure of manifestation ofthe genotype.  but 'neonatal hepatitis' may be a manifestation ofmore than one disease.  in 'neonatal hepatitis' the birth weightshows a marked decrease, perhaps as a sequence of disturbed liverfunction in the foetus.

the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney and thezona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex inthe sodium losing and the hypertensiveforms of virilizing adrenalhyperplasiapathological and biochemical observationsare presented in two cases of virilizing ad-renal hyperplasia: one of the sodium-losingtype and the other of the hypertensive type.examination of the kidneys revealed hyper-trophy of the juxtaglomerular cells in thecase exhibiting excessive sodium loss.  theadrenal cortex showed hypertrophy of thezona glomerulosa.  it is hypothesized thatthe chronic state of sodium loss causedchanges in the intravascular compartmentwhich led to compensatory activity of thejuxtaglomerular cells with resultant stimula-tion of the zona glomerulosa.examination of the hypertensive case(known to involve a different enzyme defi-cit) showed hypertrophy of the zona glom-erulosa without hypertrophy of the juxta-glomerular cells.  the intrinsic overproduc-tion of sodium-retaining steroids associatedwith the genetic defect in this clinical formcould account for both the hypertensionand the absence of hypertrophy of the juxta-glomerular apparatus.

specific carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system .a wide variety of human adult and fetal tissues were studied byimmunodiffusion techniques in agar gel to determine whether theycontained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in coloniccancers . in the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identicalantigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of theentodermally derived epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract andpancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues . thecommon antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specificcancer antigens of the human digestive system . system-specific cancerantigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans .experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigenswere also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6months of gestation . these components were named /carcinoembryonic/antigens of the human digestive system . on the basis of the presentfindings and the recent work regarding control of the expression ofgenetic potentialities in various genetic potentialities in varioustypes of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigensrepresent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course ofdifferentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappearin the corresponding malignant cells by a process ofderepressive-dedifferentiation .

2091. modern methods of treatment of visceral amyloidosis in patients withpulmonary tuberculosis (russian)the immediate and long-term results oftreatment during 1945-1962 of 414 patientswith pulmonary tuberculosis complicatedby amyloidosis were studied.  hormonal(corticosteroid) therapy is the pathogenetictreatment for visceral amyloidosis andis indicated in the proteinuric and earlyedema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis whenthe functional capacity of the kidneys andthe liver is still adequate.  in the azotemicphase of amyloidosis, hormonal (corticosteroid)therapy is not indicated, since itleads to rapid deterioration in the patient'scondition.  since hypoxemia is one of themain factors in the pathogenesis of amyloidosis,oxygen therapy is rational patho-genetic therapy for patients with pulmonarytuberculosis complicated by hypoxemiaand with symptoms of the proteinuric oredema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis(without ascites), in the form ofsubcutaneous introduction of oxygen or oxy-geno-peritoneum.  in patients withpulmonary tuberculosis surgical interven-tion on account of the main processis indicated only in the early stages of amyloi-dosis when pronounced functionaldisorders of the kidneys and liver are absent.  co-joint therapy using protein vitamins(particularly ascorbic acid), hormonal (corticos-teroid) preparations, oxygen anddesensitizing agents and elimination of all foci ofinfection is indicated in treatmentof pulmonary tuberculosis with even the earliestsigns of amyloidosis.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero andin vitro with rubella virus.a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomeswas undertaken to determine if damageto the genetic apparatus of human cells maybe induced by rubella virus and whethersuch damage produces the pathology seenin newborns from mothers infected earlyin pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains wereinitiated in vitro from embryonic materialobtained by therapeutic abortion of fetusesfrom rubella-infected mothers.  embryonicmaterial from spontaneous and non-rubellatherapeutic abortions yielded similarcell strains for infection in vitro.  theresults from both types of studies were asfollows: (a) virus shedding cell strains wereobtained from all types of organs cultivated,which indicated wide disseminationof virus in the fetuses from rubella-infectedmothers.  (b) chronic infection couldreadily be established by in vitro infectionand no cytopathic effect was noted.(c) although many strains continued to shedvirus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,no changes in growth propertiesoccurred with the exception that infectedstrains from lung tissue showed limitedgrowth capacities.  (d) from observationsof over 2,000 metaphases, neither obviouschromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctionalchanges were observed instrains infected naturally or experimentally.(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derivedcell strains there was a marked elevationin frequency of chromosome breakage in3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlationbetween virus shedding in vitro andincreased chromosome breakage was notedalthough this was not complete.  (g) thecombined average frequency of chromosomebreakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortionstrains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortusstrains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,but significant elevation in average chromosomebreak frequency (9.8%) was obtainedin four cell strains which had been experimentallyinfected in vitro with rubella virus(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effectsupon the chromosomes were demonstrated,these were restricted to slight general elevationsin frequency of breakage abovenormal values.  very high increases in breakswere sporadic.  it appears more likelythat the general fetal abnormalities associatedwith rubella infection in vivo resultfrom possible effects of the virus upon growthrather than from effects upon thechromosomes.  however, the studies wererestricted to fibroblasts cultured invitro; and effects on other types of cellsmay have greater implications for thisquestion.
