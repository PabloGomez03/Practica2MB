1577. mode of action of selenium in relation to biological activity oftocopherolsdietary selenium at levels below 1 ppm has a partially beneficial effectupon nutritional muscular dystrophy but is ineffective or detrimentalat higher levels.  the role of selenium in improving the effectiveness ofvitamin e is due at least in part to the fact that dietary selenium increasesthe retention of the a-tocopherols, especially d-a-tocopherol.  this has beenshown by chemical determination of plasma tocopherols and also by tracing theactivities of tritiated tocopherols and selenium75 in serum and in variousfractions of serum proteins in chicks receiving these nutrients alone and incombination.  se75 and h3-a-tocopherol activities followed each other veryclosely in the serum proteins.  these studies indicated that vitamin e may becarried by a selenolipoprotein fraction associated with serum y-globulin.  thus,one biological role of selenium appears to lie in a selenium-containingcompound which acts as a carrier of vitamin e and which may function inabsorption, retention, prevention of destruction, and perhaps transfer acrosscell membranes of d-a-tocopherol, thereby enhancing its biological activityin the blood and perhaps in cells throughout the body.

metabolism and excretion of bilirubin c in experimental obstructivejaundice.bile duct ligation was carried out in a series ofrhesus monkeys.  the time required for the serum bilirubinto stop rising and achieve a relatively stable level,and the average serum bilirubin reached, paralleled closelythat seen clinically.  after the serum bilirubin levelshad stopped rising and a 'steady state' had been reached,radioactive bilirubin was injected i.v.  the radioisotope wasdistributed principally extravascularly and not in the sameratio as albumin, as in other forms of jaundice.  daily turnoverof bilirubin was found to be double that anticipatedfrom normal hb breakdown, suggesting increased bilirubinproduction in obstructive jaundice.  in animals followed for2 wk nearly 80% of injected radioactivity was excreted in theurine, indicating that in obstructive jaundice the kidneytakes over entirely from the liver the function of bilirubinexcretion.

effects of hypophysectomy and growth hormone on renal compensatoryhypertrophy in rats.the effect of hypophysectomy on renal compensatoryhypertrophy (rch) was observed in unilaterallynephrectomized rats receiving no therapy and thosereceiving replacement therapy and was compared to therch attained by non-hypophysectomized unilaterallynephrectomized rats at 2, 5, and 10 days.  in the lattergroup there was an initial rapid rch seen at day 2which continued, but at a slower rate, through day 10.in the hypophysectomized group without replacementtherapy there was also an initial rch in the first 48 hrs.however, instead of the rch continuing there was aregression in kidney size at 5 days and with no subsequentchange at 10 days.  in the hypophysectomized groupreceiving hormone replacement there was an initialrch comparable to the other 2 groups, but the furtherrenal enlargement at 10 days was much less than thatof the non-hypophysectomized animals.  the results ofthis experiment and of other reported studies implyexistence of a renotropic factor which is not producedin the pituitary, but which requires an intact pituitaryfor full effectiveness.

renal factors in the pathogenesis of hypertensionrenal arteriography and other modern diagnostic procedures have providedthe means of establishing a close relationship between high blood pressure andrenovascular disease.  many of these cases are amenable to surgical cure.  atthe present time there is no single test for the definitive diagnosis of renalhypertension.  careful and intensive studies are mandatory in the selection ofcases suitable for surgery, since hypertension has many etiologic factors andinvolves many complex and sometimes obscure mechanisms.  aortography,intravenous urography and split-function tests are among the most importantmethods for definitive diagnosis and for the planning of appropriate surgicalprocedures.at operation, the most commonly observed cause of renal arterial con-striction in the elderly is atherosclerosis, whereas in younger patients it ishyperplasia of the intimal and muscular coats of the renal artery and itsbranches.  renovascular surgery may require a variety of technical procedures.in the successful cases there is a striking and permanent reduction in bloodpressure.the accuracy of blood pressure readings is emphasized, since hypertensionis usually discovered for the first time during the course of a routinephysical examination.

2302. the carcinogenic activities of n-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene and itsmetal chelates as a function of retention at the injection sitethe carcinogenic activities of s.c. administeredn-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene(n-hydroxy-aaf) and a variety of its metal chelates indicate that greateractivity locally is associated with a longer retention of the chelates at thesite of injection with a slow release of n-hydroxy-aaf to the surroundingtissue.  no tumors were obtained at the sites of 4 injections of n-hydroxy-aaf(3.2 mg. /injection), but 4 and 16 of 20 rats developed sarcomas at thesites of 8 and 16 injections, respectively.  the nickelous, cobaltous, ferric,or cupric chelates induced moderate to high incidences of sarcomas with 1 or 4injections; in these cases one-half of the administered n-hydroxy-aaf wasretained at the injection site for 4-50 days.  the manganous and zinc chelatesand the potassium salt were less active at the injection site; thehalf-retention times for these ranged from 2.5 hr. to 2.5 days.  the comparablehalf-retention time for n-hydroxy-aaf was about 2 hr.  injection of the metalderivatives s. c. with short half-retention times resulted in higher incidencesof mammary tumors than injection of the derivatives with half-retentiontimes of 4 or more days.  when administered in the food the cupric chelateof n-hydroxy-aaf induced the same spectrum of tumors as n-hydroxy-aaf,but the incidences were lower.  while the prolonged retention of the materialat the injection site may account for the greater carcinogenic activities ofthe metal chelates, serious consideration must also be given to the possibleimportance of chelation of carcinogens or their metabolites to cellularconstituents.

electron microscopy of cytoplasmic inclusions within /macrophages/ ofhuman tissue .the fine structure of inclusions found within the cytoplasm ofmacrophages of human lung, spleen, skin, lymph node, and rectum has beendescribed .the inclusions appear as concentric or whorled lamellae arrangedaround a core . each lamella is constructed of discrete, parallelfilaments . the inclusions do not resemble currently described virusesor virus-like particles, nor do they resemble asbestos bodies or otherknown atmospheric pollutants or ingestants .there is some resemblance to lipid phase systems as well as mast cellgranules,. possibly the inclusions represent partial intracellulardigestion of phagocytized tissue membranes or ingested mast cellgranules, respectively . differences and similarities exist between theinclusion bodies of macrophages and the granules of mast cells . suchvariations could be due to alterations in mast cell granule morphologybefore or after macrophage ingestion .cytologic distinctions between macrophages laden with mast cellgranules and mast cells proper, remains obscure and requires additionalexperimental evidence for clear electron microscopic differentiation ofthese two cell types .the exact nature of these highly structured bodies remains speculative

surgical treatment of atrial septal defect under hypothermia .the technique of inflow occlusion under 30 c. hypothermia was adoptedfor direct visual correction in 133 consecutive cases of atrial septaldefect of the secundum variety and the associated anomalies .the use of extracorporeal circulation combined with hypothermia wasreserved for the repair of two cases of ostium primum defects .the over-all operative mortality was 4 .post-operative evaluation showed that the results have been good inalmost all patients, including those with pulmonary hypertension .since an ostium primum defect requires cardio-pulmonary bypass for itsclosure, the pre-operative recognition of the defect is highly desirablein the selection of patients for operation and in planning the procedureitself .the information derived from the clinical examination and appropriatediagnostic studies has been found to be consistently accurate in thepre-operative differentiation of the primum from the secundum defect .therefore, the unexpected discovery of a primum defect at operation wasnot a problem .in our experience, open-heart surgery under 30 c. hypothermia for therepair of an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and theassociated anomalies is a safe and practical technique and effectivelycorrects the anomaly with minimal risk .

2406. profound hypothermiathe aim of hypothermia is protection of vitalcerebral structures from hypoxiaduring aneurysm repair; profound hypothermiais also valuable in operating oncertain cardiac defects which cannot be repairedeven with whole body perfusion.since the time needed for aneurysm repair oftenexceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12minutes without circulation afforded by surfacehypothermia of 29  to 30  c., theauthors have investigated the drew (open-chest)technic, the closed-chest method,and isolated cerebral perfusion.  the drew technicconsists of substituting twopumps for the heart while the patient's lungs actas the oxygenator.  because of itsdisadvantages (the large amounts of blood neededand the morbidity due to intra-cardiac cannulation and median sternotomy), aclosed-chest method was developed,using a mayo-gibbons vertical-sheet pump-oxygenatorto provide the perfusion andextracorporeal cooling without requiring thoracotomy.in cerebral perfusion, bloodis taken from one artery, pumped through a heatexchanger, and returned to anotherartery.  the authors describe anesthetic technics,offer comparisons of the threemethods, give instructions pertaining to the productionof hypothermia, and list theproblems encountered in the management of these cases.

isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from adults with respiratoryinfections.isolation of mycoplasma organisms from the sputumwas attempted in 254 patients with various syndromeof respiratory disease.  isolates were obtained in 56% ofthe 197 patients with pneumonia, 50% of patients withchronic bronchial diseases who were not treated withtetracycline, and 33% of persons with acute upper respiratoryinfection.  these differences are not statisticallysignificant and indicate a nonpathogenic role for m.pharyngis and m. salivarium which were the strains mostfrequently isolated.  the highest frequency of isolationwas from males 15 to 30 yr. of age.  isolation of m.pneumoniae requires one to 2 weeks:therefore, it is notuseful for rapid diagnosis.  also, it underestimates theprevalence of infection, especially if patients have receivedtetracycline.  of the serologic tests, complement-fixation(cf) was the most specific.  the growthinhibition test (tri) was the most sensitive and wassignificantly related to atypical pneumonia.  the 2 testsmay measure different antibodies against m. pneumoniae.serum cold agglutinins developed in many casesof pneumonia and were poorly discriminatory in etiologicdiagnosis.  m. pneumoniae infection occurred in aminimum of 8% and a maximum of 20% of civilian patientshospitalized for pneumonia during the season studied.serologic evidence for m. pneumoniae was rare inlobar pneumonia.  in nonlobar pneumonia, m. pneumoniaeaccounted etiologically for 13% to 50% of cases.  the incidenceof m. pneumoniae infection was constant indifferent seasons but greatest relative to the occurrenceof pneumonia in the fall and spring.

4612. flow considerations in regional cerebral hypothermiait is suggested that low flows are dangerousand may cause anoxia either directlyor by interfering with cooling.  sixty dogshave been subjected to local cerebralhypothermia by the method of femoral tocarotid cooling of arterial blood with per-fusion at a predetermined pressure ratherthan predetermined flow rate.  the cir-cuit is described and its advantages forclinical use mentioned together with its in-accuracies as a method of scientific investigation.these are chiefly concernedwith maintenance of systemic blood pressurewhich may require the injection ofpressor agents.  evidence for reduction in flowat low temperatures is discussedand evidence presented that this is not only dueto increase in viscosity but thatthere is an active spasm, manifested by'rewarming humps' which occur in thecooling graphs.  mean carotid flow rateswere determined by a revolution counterattached to a pump of fixed stroke volume,the output of which was linked to the per-fusion pressure and thus determined by the resistance.the place of added co2is discussed particularly in relation to the fallin partial pressure which accompa-nies the cooling of the blood.  the addition of 5% co2did not increase total carotidflows.  halothane had been used as an anestheticbecause of its sympatholytic ac-tion.  it has increased flows by 37% andabolished 'rewarming humps'.  rheomacro-dex used as a priming fluid instead of bloodproduced increased flow averaging 75%but did not abolish spasm.  it is suggested thatcooling faster than 1 c. per minuteis not intrinsically dangerous if spasm is preventedand high flow maintained by the methods described.

infectivity of dna isolated from bacillus subtilis bacteriophage, sp82 .sp82, a newly isolated bacteriophage of bacillus subtilis, isdescribed . sp82 is closely related to sp8, but differs from sp8 in thedensity of its denatured dna and in its plating effciency on b. subtilisstrain sb-1 .dna isolated from this phage can be recovered in molecular weightequivalent to the amount contained in a single phage (approximately 130x 10 daltons) . dna of this molecular weight, but not half pieces, isinfective in competent b. subtilis . the response of plaque-formingability to dna concentration suggests that four whole molecules arerequired to initiate an infective center . recombination studies withmixed dna's of two non-allelic temperature-sensitive mutants confirm theexistence of an obligatory co-operative infective process . a secondinfective procedure that utilizes extracted phage dna is described . inthis system, low concentrations of wild-type dna are exposed to thecells . at these concentrations the multiple-event nature of phage dnainfection precludes the formation of unaided plaques . however, bysubsequently superinfecting the dna-infected cells with atemperature-sensitive mutant and plating under selective conditions,genetic rescue of the infecting dna is accomplished and detected .infective centers elicited by this /marker rescue/ phenomenon aredirectly proportional to dna concentration . the time of attainment ofdnase resistance by phage dna infective centers that have irreversiblyadsorbed dna can be measured . phage dna infective centers require atleast 13 minutes to become totally dnase resistant . the reasons for thefailure of single phage dna molecules to carry out an infection arediscussed in terms of a specific breakage-reunion

1688. surface phenomena in lungs in health and diseasein summary, the authors have attemptedto bring together the multiple observationswhich seem germane to the understandingof surface phenomena in lungs in healthand disease.  to this end, the contributionsof anatomists and pathologists on thefine structure of alveolar cells and theirlining are fundamental.  the concepts ofalveolar stability required the specialinsights of physiologists who were concernedwith the causes of bubble stability asthey related to the particular problems posedby a lung of several millions of bubblesarranged in parallel.  soon the contributionsof the chemists became significant asmethods of identification and assay of the al-veolar lining material were of interest.clinicians asked what relevance these studieshad to atelectasis as it occurs in disease,and soon the question of when the surfac-tant appeared in development occurred tothose concerned with premature infants.students of metabolism began to focus onthe lung as a site of phospholipid synthesis,and their tools seem most promising atthis time in unearthing possible errors inmetabolism which may express themselvesin disease.  surgeons who undertake per-fusion of the isolated lung ask therequirements of that organ with respect to thenutrients and environment of the alveolarcells, and anesthesiologists inquire intothe possibilities of mechanical injuryto the alveoli during artificial respiration.the problems posed to the reviewersof a subject which touches so many disciplinesare obvious.  doubtless some pertinentstudies have been omitted although uninten-tionally; others may have beenmisinterpreted through lack of qualifications as spe-cialists in all specialties.  theauthors hope they have provided evidence that theforces of surface tension cannotbe ignored in an organ with an air-liquid interfaceof some 70 m2.  they further hopethey have described some of the properties ofthe film at the alveolar-air interfacewhich operate to produce stability of the alveoli.they hold the belief that study of themetabolism of the alveolar lining layer willfurther their understanding of a numberof disease processes in which it may bealtered.  and lastly, they hope for muchcloser communication between workers inmany disciplines who can elucidate thisremarkable subject best through cooperativestudies.

3446. effect of nicl2 on an isolated ranvier nodean attempt was made to explain the extreme prolongation of the nodalpotential by 0.1-1.0 mm nicl2 in terms of the ionic theory.  the effects ofnicl2 at room temperature are similar to those of temperature reductiondecreased maximum rate of rise of the action potential, lengthened actionpotential duration, elevated threshold, increased tendency for repetitiveactivity; in addition, the amplitude of the action potential is slightlyincreased.  the long-lasting plateaus of the responses obtained under thecombined influence of nicl2 and temperature reduction are shortened by cathodalpolarization, strong anodal polarization and decrease of (na)0.  the plateaucan be prematurely terminated by short anodal pulses of critical amplitude;short cathodal pulses reduce the duration of the plateau gradually withincreasing pulse strength.  increased (k)0 prolongs plateau duration; thesteep repolarization phase which normally terminates the plateau isreplaced by a long lasting after-depolarization with stepwise potentialdecline.the amplitude of k-depolarization is not influenced by nicl2 or temperaturereduction.  1.0 mm nicl2 changes the relation between maximum rate ofrise and steady-state polarization; the potential change required for 50%sodium inactivation is +8mv in normal ringer's solution and +16mv in thepresence of 1.0 mm nicl2 (22 c.).  1.0 mm nicl2 increases the time constantof delayed rectification as measured in na-poor solutions at 4 c. by a factorof about 2.  the decrease of action potential under cathodal polarization isslightly delayed by nicl2.  it is concluded that prolongation of the nodalaction potential by nicl2 is due to delayed and reduced inactivation of napermeability and delayed increase of k permeability; part of the nicl2-effectcould be explained by assuming competition between ni++ and ca++ for specificsites at the membrane.

198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note ofcautionazathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classifiedas 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects ofazathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because ofthe concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during theadministration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolongedsteroid therapy.  in 1 patient, the administration of azathioprine wasassociated with amelioration of an arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum which didnot respond to the use of steroids and other medication.  immuno-suppressiveobservations were limited.  the established delayed hypersensitivity response,as reflected in various skin tests, was unchanged during the administration ofazathioprine.  azathioprine had no discernible toxic effects upon the kidneysor the liver in 2 patients, 1 with postnecrotic cirrhosis and the other withserum hepatitis.  gastro-intestinal symptoms (anorexia, epigastric discomfort,and nausea) occurred in 8 patients.  mild to moderate leukopenia developed in 8patients and, in 2 individuals, was accompanied by thrombocytopenia.  temporaryalopecia occurred in 1 woman.  the hematopoietic effects developed within 2 or3 wk of therapy with azathioprine at a dosage level of 4-6 mg/kg/day.azathioprine does not exert the rapid beneficial effect in ulcerative colitisnoted with corticotropin and adrenal corticosteroids.  therefore, its use insevere ulcerative colitis requiring intensive therapy probably is undesirable.azathioprine, on the basis of these initial observations, may be considered formoderately severe ulcerative colitis, under circumstances permitting controlledand prolonged therapeutic trial as adjunct medication, but with carefulsupervision for prevention of toxicity, especially leukopenia.

stimulus overload, action cycles, and the completion gradientsystematic inquiries into the origin of certain emotional disturbancesof infants show that consistent maternal care is vital for thechild's normal physical, psychic, and social development, indeed,for his survival.  the most elementary precondition for consistentmaternal care is the physical presence of the mother or her substitute.it has, however, become increasingly apparent that children'sdevelopment can also be stunted, and that they suffer damage ofvarying extent by the attention of, and close contact with, a motherwho dispenses what seems to be the "wrong kind of mothering".a model of the mother-baby interaction is proposed to explicatethe dynamics of the "wrong kind of mothering" and itsconsequences: my proposition is that the mutual exchanges betweenmother and baby consist in a give and take of action andreaction between the two partners, which requires from eachof them both active and passive responses.  these responses formseries and chains, the single links of which consist in what i call"action cycles," each completed in itself and at the same timeanticipating the next link.  i designated these seriated responseexchanges as the "precursor of dialogue," as a primal dialogue.the dialogue acts as a vector of the baby's development,influencing its direction and stimulating it to adaptive efforts andpsychic growth.  it follows that inappropriate mothering (quantitativelyas well as qualitatively) results in what is referred to atthis time as the "derailment" of the primal dialogue.controlled experiments with animals, findings of experimentalpsychology, and, lastly, clinical findings illustrate themechanics of the derailed dialogue and its sequelae.in the cases under review a surfeit of stimulation, a psychicoverloading, resulted in the derailment of dialogue.  overloadingprevents its subject from completing actions or responses initiatedby him.  long-lasting overload results in the cumulation of "incompletedaction cycles".  the sequelae of this cumulation areprofound changes in the behavior of the individual.  these changesare manifested in a departure from the norms of individual andsocial behavior patterns that are maladaptive for the individualand asyntonic with his society, that is, asocial.the derailment of the dialogue is triggered, perhaps evencaused,by the nature of the social setting.  one setting, over-population,is extensively discussed in connection with an animalexperiment, and the implications for the human community areexamined.

selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially preparedantisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrinclearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecularweights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and theslope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be saidto express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfyingthe usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephroticsyndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greaterthan the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially tosteroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changesobserved on renal biopsy .2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephroticsyndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type ofproteinuria .3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for agiven pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome .4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to thetotal daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remainsfairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein beingexcreted .5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance betweenthe degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of thedisease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initialblood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type ofprotein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and hadinitially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity typeor better .7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic andhas a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy isunlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulinclearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted withany degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with thenephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise .
