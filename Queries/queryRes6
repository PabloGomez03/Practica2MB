ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation clinical, hemodynamicand surgical considerations .the clinical, hemodynamic, angiographic and anatomic findings infifteen patients with ventricular septal defect complicated by aorticregurgitation are presented . in this combination of malformations theaortic regurgitation is acquired and results from prolapse of an aorticvalve leaflet into the septal defect . the strategic location of theseptal defect in relation to the aortic leaflets appears to be moreimportant to the development of this complication than the size of thedefect or the magnitude of the shunt through it . the onset of aorticregurgitation occurs during early childhood and, once present, tends tobecome more severe . careful observation of patients with these defectsis indicated following the appearance of aortic regurgitation sincerapid progression to severe left ventricular failure is not uncommon .ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation must be distinguishedfrom other cardiovascular abnormalities producing a wide pulse pressurewith a continuous or to-and-fro murmur . cardiac catheterization andthoracic aortography are the diagnostic procedures most helpful in thisdifferentiation . the operative treatment of ventricular septal defectand aortic regurgitation is reviewed and, on the basis of the presentand previously reported results, suggested plans for surgical managementare presented .

cardiac malformations associated with ventricular septal defect .in this study, 46 necropsy-proved cases of ventricular septal defectassociated with another anomaly but not part of a recognized complexwere selected .the associated anomalies were classified as (1) obstructive orpositional anomalies of the great vessels, (2) anomalies responsible foradditional shunts, (3) anomalies causing intraventricular obstructionand (4) aortic valvular insufficiency .clinical findings were often those of the ventricular septal defect,and the findings related to the associated lesion were frequentlyobscure . even with special studies, including cardiac catheterizationand angiocardiography, there was often failure to arrive at a completediagnosis . the findings which led to an erroneous or incompletediagnosis have been presented . when a complete diagnosis was madepreoperatively, the procedures leading to it have been outlined . whilethe diagnostic approach varies with the malformations which may coexistwith ventricular septal defect, it was observed that aortography andselective left ventricular angiocardiography were most commonly helpfulin identifying occult malformations associated with ventricular septaldefect . it is therefore recommended that complete studies, includingleft-sided cardiac catheterization with left ventricularangiocardiography and aortography, should be considered in all cases inwhich the clinical, electrocardiographic, and right-sided cardiaccatheterization studies are not entirely typical for isolatedventricular septal defect .

2431. the natural history of arrhythmias following septal defect reapirthe repair of 191 atrial and ventricular septaldefects between 1955 and 1961 wasreviewed to determine the incidence and prognosisof arrhythmias related to operation.cases included 90 ventricular septal defects, 61atrial defects of the ostium secundumtype, and 40 of the ostium primum variety.nodal rhythms, second degree blocks,complete heart block, and flutter or fibrillation thatpersisted after completion of operationwere analyzed, while intermittent ectopic beats,sinus tachycardia, and bundle branchblocks were excluded.  fifteen per cent of thepatients with ventricular defects, 17%with ostium primum defects, and 35% with ostiumsecundum defects developed abnormalrhythms associated with repair.  of 18 patients whosearrhythmias began during operation,there were 8 deaths; no fatalities occurred in the 24patients who developed arrhythmiasin the postoperative period.  seven deaths wereassociated with complete heart block andone with second degree block.  although only onehalf of the patients who developedarrhythmias had pulmonary artery pressure greaterthan 30 mm. hg systolic, all fatalitiesoccurred in this group.  four of the deaths followedsurgery with the use of the pumpoxygenator in children under 30 months of age.thirty-eight per cent of the abnormalrhythms that began in the postoperative periodwere nodal.  flutter and fibrillationwere common following repair of atrial secundumdefects in patients over 15 yr. of agebut did not occur in younger patients.  deaths fromheart block occurred in the first 30 daysfollowing operation except one, 5 months later.survivors of complete heart block revertedto a less serious arrhythmia or normal rhythmwithin 3 months.

1021. left ventricular angiocardiography in the study of ventricularseptal defectssixty-five cases of ventricular septal defectwere studied by left angiocardiography.the left ventricle was entered by retrogradearterial catheterization with a catheterhaving a j-shaped tip.  this procedure appearsto be little, or no more, hazardousthan right-sided angiocardiography.  ventricularseptal defects may be divided into5 types, depending on their location in the ventricularseptum.  the anatomic andradiological features of the septum and septal defectsare described.  selective in-jection of contrast material into the left ventricleopacifies the blood passing throughthe defect in the septum and permits preoperativelocalization of the defect in rela-tion to identifiable anatomic landmarks.  multipledefects of the septum are well de-monstrated.  such information may be ofconsiderable value to the surgeon under-taking repair of the septum.  left ventriculography,often combined with supraval-vular aortography, has been used, when indicated,to differentiate between mitralinsufficiency and ventricular septal defect and inthe detection of other cardiac ano-malies whose manifestations are marked by thoseof the septal lesion.  this tech-nique is well suited to the postoperative study ofpatients following repair of theseptal defect and for follow-up studies in patientsnot operated upon to clarify thenatural history of defects in different portions ofthe ventricular septum.

1991. ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation.medical and pathologic aspectsthirty-four patients with ventricular septal defectand aortic regurgitation, repre-senting less than 5% of the patients with ventricularseptal defect, are discussed.a loud, systolic murmur, characteristic of ventricularseptal defect, is noted dur-ing infancy, whereas evidences of aortic regurgitation(protodiastolic murmur andwide pulse pressure) does not usually appear until sometime between 2 and 10years of age.  clinical and catheterization data indicatethat the principal hemody-namic load is aortic regurgitation, whereas theventricular septal defect does notusually result in a large pulmonary blood flow orhigh pulmonary arterial pressure.in about 50% of the patients, a significant pressuregradient across the right ven-tricular outflow tract exists.  detailed pathologicstudies indicate that the ventricularseptal defects are high and anterior and encroachto a greater or lesser degree onthe membranous bulbar septum.  the right coronarycusp is the one most severelyinvolved, and, by its prolapse, causes aorticregurgitation; the noncoronary cuspis always less severely affected.  the anatomic basisof the pressure gradient ob-served across the right ventricular outflow tract isnot always clear.

surgical treatment of atrial septal defect under hypothermia .the technique of inflow occlusion under 30 c. hypothermia was adoptedfor direct visual correction in 133 consecutive cases of atrial septaldefect of the secundum variety and the associated anomalies .the use of extracorporeal circulation combined with hypothermia wasreserved for the repair of two cases of ostium primum defects .the over-all operative mortality was 4 .post-operative evaluation showed that the results have been good inalmost all patients, including those with pulmonary hypertension .since an ostium primum defect requires cardio-pulmonary bypass for itsclosure, the pre-operative recognition of the defect is highly desirablein the selection of patients for operation and in planning the procedureitself .the information derived from the clinical examination and appropriatediagnostic studies has been found to be consistently accurate in thepre-operative differentiation of the primum from the secundum defect .therefore, the unexpected discovery of a primum defect at operation wasnot a problem .in our experience, open-heart surgery under 30 c. hypothermia for therepair of an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and theassociated anomalies is a safe and practical technique and effectivelycorrects the anomaly with minimal risk .

4159. detection of heart shunts by means of i 125external scintillation detection of a pure dilutioncurve originating in the right ven-tricle has been pursued by investigators for manyyr.  the use of the soft photonsof 125 i offers an improved method of determinationby allowing excellent collimationthrough 2 mechanisms  (1) a small half value layerof 2 cm in tissue, and (2) uni-directionality, in part due to all-or-none photoelectricabsorption of these photonsas compared with the pluridirectionality due to comptonscatter in the case of 131 i.in 30 normal individuals, externally detected dilutioncurves from the right heartventricle and arterial dilution curves obtained by arterialpuncture are compared.five hundred microcuries of 125 i are injected into anantecubital vein.  the amountof radiation absorbed from a 500 uc dose in an adult of70 kilos is 1000 to 2000mrads when injected in the form of 125 i iodide.  the useof 125 i orthoiodohippu-rate is advised due to its short biological half-period andthe integrated whole-bodyradiation exposure is decreased 100-fold in comparisonwith the 125 i iodide.  theshape of the right heart curve is very similar to the arterialdilution curve with a13   5% excess of counts originating outside the right ventriclearea.  the descendingsegment of the right ventricle curve has a minimum count rateof only 12   2% of thepeak of the curve as compared with the arterial curve of 102.5%.  a mean t 1/2of the descending down slope of the right ventricle is 1.520.45 sec. for the rightheart curve and 2.4   0.65 sec. for the arterial curve.the clinical usefulness of thisprocedure in 20 patients with atrial septal defects and 9patients with ventricular sep-tal defects is analyzed.  it seems possible to perform selectiveright-heart radiocardio-graphy by means of external precordial detection of 125 i.  themethod is simple andreproducible.

375. hemianopsia and glaucomaafter a discussion of the bibliographic references to the few observations onthe simultaneous occurrence of hemianopsias and glaucoma the author states onthe basis of his experiences the following points  homonymous hemianopsiasoccasionally take place in glaucoma, although no direct relation can beestablished between the former and the glaucoma.  it has to be pointed out,however, that in other older patients, for example in those with retinaldetachment, neuritis, etc. who are likewise subjected to repeated and exactperimetry, such hemianopsias do not occur, or are to be found at a lesser ratethan in glaucoma.  a homonymous hemianopsia has to be taken into considerationalso in the event of a sudden impairment of the visual field in a glaucomatouspatient or when the hemianopic defect supervenes in addition to the visualfield defect due to glaucoma.  in cases of binasal hemianopsia, thesimultaneous presence of glaucoma is not a rare incident.  whether thebinasal hemianopsia is the result of the gradual development of aglaucomatous visual field with nasal defects or whether it constitutes anindependent symptom to a certain extent, cannot always be clarifiedin the individual case.  obviously the condition of the basal cerebralvessels plays a certain role in the development of glaucoma, even ifthis role cannot be clearly defined as yet.  in cases ofbinasal hemianopsia, a glaucoma has to be ruled out before radical diagnosticand therapeutic measures are carried out.

2753. left ventricular function following replacement of theaortic valve.  hemodynamic responses to muscular exerciseevaluations of left ventricular myocardialfunction were carried out in 14 patients4-16 mth after stenotic or regurgitantmalformations of the aortic valve had beencorrected by valve replacement.  thecirculatory responses to exercise, judged bythe increases in cardiac output in relationto the increases in oxygen consumption,were normal or only mildly reduced in 12patients.  in 5 patients the relationshipsbetween the change in the left ventricularend-diastolic pressure and the alterationin the stroke volume were also normal, afall or an increase in left ventricularend-diastolic pressure of less than 3 mmhg being accompanied by an increase instroke volume.  in 8 patients, however,abnormal increases in the left ventricularend-diastolic pressure occurred duringexercise, and in 4 the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased to levelsabove 12 mm hg.  variable alterations inthe stroke volume accompanied these increasesin end-diastolic pressure.  it issuggested that in the 3 patients who exhibitedsimultaneous increases in left ven-tricular end-diastolic pressure and strokevolume, the changes were either a mani-festation of the frank-starling mechanism,or primarily the result of a positiveinotropic influence.  in the 5 patients whoexhibited increases in left ventricularend-diastolic pressure, but no change or afall in stroke volume, it is proposedthat a distinct depression of left ventricularperformance was present.  thus, whilethe cardiac output response was adequate tomeet the stress of exercise in themajority of the patients studied following aorticvalve replacement, determinationof the relationship between the left ventricularend-diastolic pressure and the strokevolume permitted the detection of abnormalitiesin the function of the left ventricle.

1635. intra-atrial pressure measurement and electrocardiography in thedetailed diagnosis of atrial septal defectafter discussing the possibilities andlimitations of different methods for identifyingthe anatomical type of atrial septaldefect, the authors suggest a more useful newmethod.  this consists in simultaneousrecording of both the pressure curve andendocavitary electrocardiogram duringwithdrawal of the catheter from the left intothe right atrium.  in the ostium primumtype, the septal foramen has no infe-rior margin, and the point of the catheterduring retraction (unlike in the ostiumsecundum type) rests on the intermediatesection of the atrioventricular septum.the endocavitary electrocardiogram in thezone of passage between the two atriashows the typical pattern of the intermediatesection of the atrioventricular septum;the pressure curve may show a pattern of theatrial of intravalvular type.

2476. studies on cardiac dimensions in intact,unanesthetized man. i. description of techniques and theirvalidation. ii. effects of respiration. iii. effects ofmuscular exercisea method is described which permitsmeasurement of relative changes in the exter-nal dimensions of individual cardiacchambers throughout the cardiac cycle in intact,unanaesthetized man.  it consists ofsuturing multiple radiopaque silver-tantalumclips to the surface of the heart at thetime of cardiac operations.  in the postopera-tive period, cineradiograms areobtained and the distances between clips are mea-sured on each individual frame.this technique has been found to be safe and hasbeen employed in 68 patients withoutany complications.  as a result of studies in 8patients utilizing biplane serial exposures,the effects of rotation of the heart in thesagittal plane during the cardiac andrespiratory cycles were determined precisely.if clips were properly placed on the heart,the possible errors resulting from suchrotation were found to be quite small.during inspiration right ventricular dimen-sions increased, while the opposite occurredduring expiration and during the val-salva manoeuvre.  left ventricular dimensionsexhibited little change during normalrespiration.  during deep, slow inspiration,the changes in dimensions of the leftventricle lagged behind those of the rightventricle by 1 to 5 (generally 2 or 3) car-diac cycles; the magnitude of the changes inthe dimensions of the left ventricle wassmaller than that which occurred in the rightventricle.  the effects on ventriculardimensions of light muscular exercise performedin the supine position were studiedin 9 patients.  the end-diastolic dimensionsdecreased by an average of 6.0% of con-trol in the right ventricle, and by an average of5.1% in the left ventricle.  end-sys-tolic dimensions decreased by an average of 5.6%of control in the right ventricleand by an average of 6.5% in the left ventricle.these decreases are considered toapproximate one-half of the resting stroke volume.in the 4 patients in whom therate of right ventricular pressure rise was determinedcontinuously, exercise re-sulted in an elevation of dp/dt while ventricularend-diastolic dimensions decreased.these data are interpreted to indicate that anincrease in myocardial contractilityoccurs during muscular exercise in man.

therapy for hearing-impaired childrenin comparison with the u.s.a. andeurope, canada is still in the earlystages of developing rehabilitative servicesfor speech and hearing-impairedchildren and adults.  they are availablein some large canadian cities, but inthe opinion of the authors, these servicesand more should be made availableto the hearing impaired of every canadian community.specialists in the rehabilitation ofcommunication problems, along withmembers of other medical, paramedical and social services, recognizethe vast variety of communicationproblems that can occur in personsof all ages, the tremendous handicapthat such problems represent to theindividual, the loss that such handicappedpersons represent to our societyand the pressing need for efficient andeffective rehabilitation.  more practically,it is hoped that this article hasmade its readers more aware of thevast variety of rehabilitative proceduresavailable today for the hearingimpaired.  with a better understandingof the problems of defective hearing,it is hoped that all readers, professionaland non-professional, will joinin mutual support for the establishmentof these vitally needed servicesin their respective communities.

hydrocephalus: changes in formation and absorptionof cerebrospinal fluid within thecerebral ventriclesformation, flow and absorption ofcerebrospinal fluid were measured in normaland progressively hydrocephalic dogs bysteady-state studies during ventricular per-fusion.  the formation of cerebrospinal fluidwas found to be constant, independent ofhydrostatic pressure, and unaffected by thedevelopment of hydrocephalus.  the normaldog produced 0.016 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min. in the lateral ventricles, 0.011 ml. cere-brospinal fluid/min. in the 4th ventricle and0.20 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min. in the sub-arachnoid space.  the intraventricular forma-tion of fluid was calculated to be 0.24 ml.cerebrospinal fluid/min./gm. of choroidplexus, and 0.3x10-3 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min./cm.2 of ependymal surface.absorption of cerebrospinal fluid wasfound to take place within the ventricles aswell as in the subarachnoid spaces.  the re-sistance to absorption of cerebrospinal fluidin the normal ventricle was much higher thanin the hydrocephalic ventricle.  the decreasein resistance occurred as the ventricularvolume increased and the ependyma becameflattened so that in chronic hydrocephalusthe resistance was not significantly differentthan in the normal dog.  the theory of re-stricted diffusion was applied to the data tocalculate the diffusive permeabilities of crea-tinine and urea, and from this the mean poreradius within the ventricle.using formation of cerebrospinal fluidand data on absorption, the hydrocephalicanimals could not be distinguished from thenormal with sufficient accuracy to suggestusing this as a clinical test.  the reason forthis is that intraventricular pressure hasalways been considered as if it were constantwhen, in fact, it is changing constantly.  theproblem of ventricular enlargement concernsthe ability of the craniospinal contents toadjust to and absorb the small but very rapidchanges in intracranial contents that occurwith each beat of the pulse.

2950. aortico-left ventricular tunnel.  a cause of massive aortic regurgitationand of intracardiac aneurysmthe clinical, roentgenographic, hemodynamicand pathologic findings in a 14-year-old boy with aortico-left ventricular tunnel arepresented.  the accessory channelbetween the aorta and left ventricle resulted inmassive aortic regurgitation, andthe portion of the tunnel which traversed theventricular septum was aneurysmal,displaced the posterior wall of the rightventricle and caused severe obstructionto right ventricular outflow.  the presenceof associated cardiovascular anomalies,in this and previously reported cases,suggests that the malformation is congenitalrather than acquired.  the clinical andhemodynamic manifestations of aortico-leftventricular tunnel are indistinguishablefrom those observed with the more commonforms of aortic regurgitation, and thecorrect diagnosis can be established only bythoracic aortography.  the malformationis usually recognized in childhood; sinceaortic regurgitant flow can be abolished bysimple closure of the aortic ostium,and without aortic valve replacement, theindications for operative treatmentdiffer from those which apply in aorticregurgitation due to a valvular anomaly.

some bone lesions in the course of blood diseases with special referenceto the formation of bony callus and to the treatment of fractures inpatients suffering from blood diseases.after some preliminary remarks on the embryologyand physiology of the bonemarrow and on the mechanism of coagulationof the blood, the authors pass on toa consideration of the genesis of bony callus,and the treatment of fractures inpatients suffering from blood diseases.  anaccount is given on the basis of some examplesof pathological fractures, and alsoof some traumatic fractures in subjectsaffected by various kinds of blood diseasessuch as solitary myeloma, polyosteoticplasmocytoma, waldenstroem's syndrome,the coagulopathic syndromefrom a structural defect of the fibrin coagulum,and hemophilia.  fractures in patientswith blood diseases are characterizedby an abnormal course, and, for aneffecient cure, it is necessary to make anaccurate diagnosis with regard to thepre-existing blood diseases and to re-establishhemostasis when this has beenchanged, to prevent hemorrhages, and to correctany plasma defect that may bepresent and which are reflected in the formationof the bony callus.

617. maturation of postnatal human lung and the idiopathic respiratory distresssyndromematuration and pathologic alterations of the lungin 19 newborn infants who died of idiopathic respiratorydistress syndrome were studied by light-and electronmicroscopy.  normal lungs from 6 fetuses and 11 new-borns served as controls.  in all infants with idiopathicrespiratory distress syndrome, respiratory bronchio-les and alveolar ducts usually presented the histologicpattern of mature lungs, i.e. they were predominantlylined by type i cells, which also formed the epithelialcomponent of most blood-air barriers.  well expandedalveoli exhibited a similar pattern, whereas collapsedalveoli were lined by numerous type ii cells which par-ticipated in the formation of poorly developed blood-airbarriers.  the capacity of type ii cells to produce in-clusion bodies seemed to increase with survival beyondthe 14th hr of age.  secretion of inclusion bodies andpresumably surfactant into alveolar spaces did occurbut only in the lungs of infants older than 2 days.  how-ever, this process was not accompanied by reductionin the number of type ii cells per alveolus as in the nor-mal lung.  the distribution of pathologic changes in idio-pathic respiratory distress syndrome appeared to bedetermined by the degree of maturity of the air sacs.structurally mature air sacs were associated with da-mage of epithelial lining and hyaline membrane forma-tion.  in contrast, collapsed alveoli revealed an intactepithelial lining and marked septal edema but were freeof hyaline membranes.  the findings of this study sug-gested that transudation of plasma through well develop-ed blood-air barriers was responsible for epithelialdamage and hyaline-membrane formation in air sacs.they also suggested that alveolar collapse and presuma-bly lack of surfactant were related to abnormal matura-tion of the epithelial lining and to septal edema.

frontal lobes and vision .the influence of the frontal lobe on vision is discussed based on thepresentation of a rather unusual case . after the operation of a rightfrontal brain abscess, which never had led to papilledema, there was apronounced diminution of the visual capacities of the patient,.gradually these disturbances regressed to the point of return of fullvisual acuity,. but there remained a hemianopic field defect . this andpsychological defects in the sense of a partial visual agnosia (whichlatter are also regressing very well) prompted a discussion of thoseneuroanatomical and neurophysiological observations pertinent to thefindings in this patient . the many data on the fronto-occipitalconnections in subhuman primates point to the role of the frontal lobe(area 8) in the development of visual disturbances in the sense of atemporary hemianopia with partial visual agnosia and some intellectualdeficits . contrary to a single observation in an anthropoid ape, ourcase would seem to indicate that the aforementioned combination ofsymptoms may originate in the frontal lobe,. and we hope it will promptother long-term follow-up studies of similar patients . the continuedobservation of this patient and perhaps of others will give apossibility to gain insight into the role of the frontal lobe in vision,as has been assumed for animals .

effects of aortic regurgitation on left ventricular performance directdeterminations of aortic blood flow before and after valve replacement .the volume of regurgitant blood flow and its effects on theperformance of the left ventricle were assessed at operation in 14patients with varying degrees of aortic regurgitation . instantaneousforward and regurgitant flows in the ascending aorta were measured witha sine-wave electromagnetic flowmeter simultaneously with leftventricular and aortic pressures . in eight patients who had aorticregurgitation without associated stenosis, 63 to 75 percent of the totalforward stroke volume regurgitated during the succeeding diastole . thecalculated regurgitant orifice areas ranged from 0.13 to 0.44 cm /m .after replacement of the aortic valve with a starr-edwards prosthesis,the absence of regurgitant flow was proved in every patient, and therecords of aortic blood flow closely resembled those seen in patientswith normal aortic valves . net forward blood flow increased by anaverage of 60 percent, total left ventricular stroke volume fell 42percent, and the mean aortic pressure rose 29 percent . the pressurework of the left ventricle was elevated preoperatively in five of theeight patients (average 89 g-m stroke/m ) and fell significantly to anaverage of 34 g-m stroke m after valve replacement . kinetic ventricularwork was high in seven of the eight patients and comprised 10 percent oftotal work before replacement but only 4.8 percent afterward .similar observations were made in five patients with aortic stenosisand associated aortic regurgitation, ranging in severity from 24 to 72percent of total forward stroke volume . in four patients in whom thevalve was replaced, no residual regurgitation was present afterward, andnet forward flow rose an average of 49 percent . kinetic leftventricular work was extremely high in every patient and averaged 26percent of total work preoperatively and 13 percent after valvereplacement . in this group, pressure work was variable both before andafter operation .the studies described provide definitive information concerning theeffects of aortic valve disease on left ventricular performance in manand document the favorable changes in flow, pressure, and leftventricular work which immediately follow aortic valve replacement .

etiology of trypan blue induced antenatalhydrocephalus in the albino ratwistar strain albino rats were injected with 1 cm3 of a 1% solutionof trypan blue.  three types of dye were used: matheson, coleman and bell,chroma-gesellschaft and a highly purified sample.  the dyes were injected ondays 6, 7, and 8 of gestation.  fetuses were excised from days 16 through 20,fixed, decalcified where necessary, embedded in paraffin, serially sectionedand stained.  newborn young were treated similarly.  chroma-gesellschafttrypan blue was without reproductive or teratogenic effect at the above doses.increasing the dose did not increase the teratogenicity but did yield adecrease in litter size.  both matheson, coleman and bell trypan blue and thepurified sample were teratogenic.  the most frequent neural defect observedwas hydrocephalus.  serial sections of the newborn hydrocephalics showed anoccluded or extremely tenotic aqueduct of sylvius in 31 of 33 sectionedanimals.  the fetuses collected from days 18 through 20 also had occluded orstenotic aqueducts if hydrocephalic.  aqueductal stenosis or occlusion waspresent in 17-day-old fetuses, but hydrocephalus was not conclusivelydemonstrated at this age.  sixteen-day-old fetuses did not have aqueductalocclusion in any of those examined, but stenosis was evident.  it is concludedthat the defect predisposing to hydrocephalus in the young of trypan bluetreated rats of this strain is aqueductal stenosis or occlusion.

epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) as a therapeutic agent based on 5years clinical experience.experience in the treatment of 744 patients withe-aca suggested that the use of the preparation is indicatedin the following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhagein association with delivery.  (2) acute systemicfibrinolysis in association with surgery.  it ismainly major operations on the thorax, pancreas, prostate,liver and genital organs that are complicated byfibrinolysis, but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur afterany operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis in patientswith cancer, particularly cancer of the prostateand pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicatingvarious disorders, especially leukaemia, livercirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote inthrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activityin the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduceblood losses following prostatectomy, especially if thetreatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopicallyclear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumaticinjury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia andother coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effectivewhether given orally or intravenously.  in stateswith increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity inthe urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day hasproved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug one.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function testswere observed, not even in cases receiving more than1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs ofintravascular coagulation in connection with e-acatherapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications after prostatectomy in patientstreated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.judging from the authors' experience in this materiale-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.

parathyroid function in chronic renal failure.  a statistical surveyof the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy.a collection has been made of 134 personal andpublished cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in whichadequate information was available concerning thepathological state of the bones.  measurements wereavailable of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, andblood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonateand plasma proteins in a representative sample.the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the wholeseries of 134 cases were not related reciprocally butwere correlated directly.  these data were further analyzedby allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups,according to the type of pathological lesions present inthe bones.  in one group there was evidence of defectivemineralization of skeletal tissues, in the form of eitherrickets or osteomalacia, and the plasma-calcium wasfound to be statistically sub-normal.  in the other groupthere was no primary defect of mineralization but thelesions of generalized osteitis fibrosa were present andthe plasma calcium was statistically normal.  there wasno significant correlation between the plasma levels ofcalcium and phosphate in either sub-group; and the plasmaphosphate was significantly higher in the group withthe higher plasma calcium levels.  the data indicate thatin patients with renal osteodystrophy, contrary to generalbelief, the plasma calcium varies independently of theplasma phosphate.  since these results imply differencesin parathyroid function among patients with azotemicosteodystrophy, a survey has also been made ofthe recorded parathyroid weights in chronic renal failure.generalized osteitis fibrosa and the accompanying normallevels of plasma calcium are associated with greaterparathyroid hypertrophy than is found in most casesof chronic renal failure or cases with defective mineralization.the various data are interpreted in relationto the known metabolic disturbances and natural historyof azotemic osteodystrophy.  by analogy with states ofsimple vitamin d deficiency, it is suggested that hypocalcemiaand relative unresponsiveness to the calcemicaction of parathyroid hormone are related to an acquiredresistance to vitamin d.  the group of cases with statisticallynormal plasma-calcium prove that the parathyroidglands can function effectively in some patientswith chronic renal failure, irrespective of the level ofthe plasma phosphate.  the size of the glands and theeffects of sub-total parathyroidectomy in patients of thisgroup suggest that the normal plasma calcium resultsfrom an increased production of parathyroid hormone.the more advanced renal failure in the normocalcemic,as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could meanthat the development of an effective degree of secondaryhyperparathyroidism is a function of the duration of therenal disease.  it seems likely that when the parathyroidresponse is sufficient to overcome the effects of the vitamind resistance it also entails the development of generalizedosteitis fibrosa, healing of the defect of mineralizationand increased liability to metastatic calcification.

the meaning of ph at low temperatures during extra-corporeal circulationa review of the temperature gradients occurring during profoundhypothermia is made in regard to acid base changes in general, and to phreadings in particular . it is concluded that terms such as 'body','mean', 'average' and 'core' temperature should be discarded and thatwhen a temperature is quoted it should be referred to the site at whichit was measured .the main circumstances in which blood ph is measured at a temperaturedifferent from that at which the blood is equilibrated with respiratorygases are reviewed by describing the changes which occur duringtonometry experiments . in this way fundamental changes can beunderstood before considering the more complicated sequences of eventstaking place in the living body .the alterations that occur in the concentrations of protein andbicarbonate ion when whole blood is cooled are reviewed, together withtheir influence on 'correction factors' . the reasons why these factorsshould not be applied to blood when the living body is undergoinghypothermia involving the use of an extra-corporeal circulation arediscussed .examples of the numerical values for blood ph during the two mainmethods for producing profound hypothermia, one using autogenous lungperfusion and the other a pump-oxygenator are given, with reference tothe influence of pco2 upon these values .the existing methods of acid-base measurement appear to besufficiently accurate to reflect the metabolic component during profoundhypothermia .

2344. respiratory and cardiovascular changes during rapid spon-taneous variations of ventricular fluid pressure in pa-tients with intracranial hypertensionin patients with intracranial hypertensionthe ventricular fluid pressure (vfp)curve is characterized by 3 main formsof spontaneous variations.  two of theseforms are of a rhythmical nature, andare here called 1-per-minute waves and 6-per-minute waves, respectively, inaccordance with the dominating frequency.the third form - irregularly appearingwaves of large amplitude and duration -is called plateau waves in accordancewith the usual shape of the fluctuations.respiratory and cardio-vascular changesaccompanying these variations of the vfpwere studied by simultaneous recording,in various combinations, of the vfp, thepulmonary ventilation, the pco2 of theexpiratory air, the arterial and the venousblood pressure, and the pulse frequency.it was found that the rhythmic vfp vari-ations of the 1-per-minute type occurredsynchronously with the respiratory peri-ods in cheyne-stokes breathing.synchronously appearing variations in systemicblood pressure, in pulse frequency,as well as in consciousness and in musculartone of the limbs were also noted.  therespiratory midposition shifted towards theinspiratory side during the periods ofhyperpnoea.  the 6-per-minute waves wereentirely synchronous with variationsin the systemic arterial blood pressure of thetraube-hering-mayer type.  longsequences of these waves were observed onlywhen the vfp level was considerablyelevated.  the plateau waves were not accom-panied by corresponding elevations ofthe arterial or venous systemic blood pres-sure.  simultaneously with the crestsof the plateau waves sudden changes oftenoccurred in the pulse frequency (frombradycardia to tachycardia), and in the res-piratory pattern, sometimes also in thedegree of consciousness and in the muscu-lar tone.  there were also long sequencesof 6-per-minute waves.  the deep, irre-gular breathing seen in this stage induceda considerable hypocapnia preceedingthe final critical fall in the vfp ending theplateau wave.  in most instances, how-ever, this fall did not begin until severalminutes after the appearance of the hypo-capnia.

pneumoencephalographic changes in the cavum septi pellucidi and theirclinical significance.the pneumoencephalographic appearances andclinical problems associated withcommunicating and non-communicating cavumsepti pellucidi are discussed on thebasis of 11 cases.  non-communicating cspmay lead to intermittent headaches dueto variations of intracranial pressure andobstruction to the flow of csf.  in rarecases, representing a special etiologicalgroup, the foramina of monro and theaqueduct may be narrowed.  a communicatingcsp is generally associated with mildto moderate symmetrical internal hydrocephalus.in the author's opinion this is inmost cases a direct result of the cavum, sincefluid continues to be formed in thecavum after communication with the rest ofthe ventricular system has been established.the conditions resemble those inhypersecretory hydrocephalus.  for thesereasons the author rejects the view that acommunicating csp is of no clinicalsignificance.  in some cases the possibility of acombination of a cavum with a cerebralmalformation must be considered.

reaction of the adrenal cortex during controlled experimentalhypothermia .the stress reaction caused by hypothermia was studied in rabbitssubjected to controlled hypothermia by immersion in an icebath . some ofthe animals were re-warmed . to anesthetize the animals, pentobarbitonesodium (nembutal) was given intraperitoneally, and, in some cases,followed by ether anesthesia . further, the stress reaction produced bypentobarbitone alone was studied in five animals, and that of etheranesthesia alone in three . no anesthesia was given to the three rabbitsplaced in the refrigerator . the variation in distribution and amount ofadrenocortical lipids served as an indicator for evaluation of thestress reaction .in all the hypothermia tests there occurred changes in thedistribution and amount of cortical lipids, denoting a stress reactionbrought about by hypothermia . in rabbits, the barbiturate did not seemto inhibit the stress reaction . this may be attributed partly to thetest animal, as such and partly to the fact that shivering of someextent always occurred during the hypothermia experiments .

pulmonary vascular plexiform lesion pathogenetic studies .an attempt was made to test the theory that in pulmonary arterialhypertension, the plexiform lesion is a jet lesion beyond points ofarterial stenosis resulting from nonspecific intimal thickening .in 39 subjects with such congenital communications as are associatedwith pulmonary arterial hypertension, the lungs were studiedhistologically . in each, there was an additional element of pulmonaryvenous obstruction . it is likely that in the absence of pulmonaryvenous obstruction, adult patients with only the congenitalcommunication would have developed plexiform lesions .in the three adult patients in the study, no plexiform lesions wereidentified . among the 36 infants or children, one subject showedplexiform lesions, a 53-day-old girl with mitral atresia, ventricularseptal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus .while the findings in the three adult subjects support the theoryregarding the genesis of plexiform lesions, the findings in the oneinfant with plexiform lesions appear to contradict it .

3762. aberrant left coronary arteryfive cases of aberrant coronary artery arepresented, with emphasis on the angio-graphic features and differentiation fromendocardial fibroelastosis.  clinical andelectrocardiographic features may suggestthe proper diagnosis, but only angio-graphy can conclusively demonstrate thecontinuity between the pulmonary arteryand the left coronary artery.  in these cases,blood flow was from the pulmonaryartery to the coronary artery (forward) in 2cases, and from the coronary arteryto the pulmonary artery (retrograde) in theother 3.  when the diagnosis of aberrantcoronary artery is suspected, selectiveleft-sided angiocardiography should be theangiographic procedure of choice.  the differentiationfrom endocardial fibroelas-tosis and other myocardiopathies is usually not aproblem with such a study, butmay be more difficult with intravenous angiocardiography.with this latter type ofstudy, the coronary arteries are not generally visible,but a persistently thin la-teral aspect of the left ventricular wall should suggestthe proper diagnosis.  sub-sequent confirmation by a left-sided injection is advisable.

an electron microscopic study of developing gallbladder epithelium in the rabbitthe gall bladder epithelium of theadult rabbit consists of two types of cells.the first and more common type shows features associated with absorption,notably microvilli, limited pinocytosis, some lysosomes and an elaboration ofthe lateral cell membrane and intercellular spaces.  the mitochondria areconcentrated in a subapical band.the second and more infrequent type is a dark rod-shaped cell of unknownfunction but which may be a dehydrated epithelial cell.foetal epithelial cells lack the functional adult characteristics; the mito-chondria are uniformly distributed.  in addition they display basal granulesand apical apocrine bullae.epithelial cell damage and white cell infiltration occurs between 24 daysafter birth or just after.just before birth some epithelial cells are very large and pale with smoothoutlines, others are more dense and display vigorous pinocytosis.adult characteristics are acquired at or immediately after birth and pino-cytosis subsides.  it is believed that water resorption occurs before thefunctional changes which allow continuous passage of water into thecirculation.

posterior scalloping of vertebral bodies in uncontrolled hydrocephalus.two cases of extensive posterior scallopingof the vertebral bodies are presentedin men aged 17 and 23 years, havinglong-standing hydrocephalus.  twoadditional cases with scalloping of only onelumbar vertebra when partially controlledhydrocephalus has been present for a shortertime are also noted.  no previousassociation between these entities has beenrecorded.  it is supposed that the increasedintraspinal pressure which must havebeen present in the first 2 patients formany years, was present near the time ofclosure of the epiphysis at the junction ofthe arch and the bodies and caused not onlywidening of the spinal canal but alsoexcavation of the vertebral bodies.  scallopingof vertebral bodies has been describedin: (1) neoplasms (neurofibromas,meningiomas, gliomas, hemangio-endotheliomas,hemangiomas, lipomas): (2) intraspinalcysts (intradural arachnoid cysts,tarlov's perineural cysts, thoracic extraduralcysts in kyphosis dorsalis juvenilis):(3) congenital anomalies of the spine andcord (fusion defects, myelodysplasia,hydromyelia, absence of a single vertebralpedicle, meningoceles): and(4) neurofibromatosis (with or without a thoracic meningocele).

198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note ofcautionazathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classifiedas 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects ofazathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because ofthe concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during theadministration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolongedsteroid therapy.  in 1 patient, the administration of azathioprine wasassociated with amelioration of an arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum which didnot respond to the use of steroids and other medication.  immuno-suppressiveobservations were limited.  the established delayed hypersensitivity response,as reflected in various skin tests, was unchanged during the administration ofazathioprine.  azathioprine had no discernible toxic effects upon the kidneysor the liver in 2 patients, 1 with postnecrotic cirrhosis and the other withserum hepatitis.  gastro-intestinal symptoms (anorexia, epigastric discomfort,and nausea) occurred in 8 patients.  mild to moderate leukopenia developed in 8patients and, in 2 individuals, was accompanied by thrombocytopenia.  temporaryalopecia occurred in 1 woman.  the hematopoietic effects developed within 2 or3 wk of therapy with azathioprine at a dosage level of 4-6 mg/kg/day.azathioprine does not exert the rapid beneficial effect in ulcerative colitisnoted with corticotropin and adrenal corticosteroids.  therefore, its use insevere ulcerative colitis requiring intensive therapy probably is undesirable.azathioprine, on the basis of these initial observations, may be considered formoderately severe ulcerative colitis, under circumstances permitting controlledand prolonged therapeutic trial as adjunct medication, but with carefulsupervision for prevention of toxicity, especially leukopenia.

decrease in serum and urinary phosphorus in manin the course of pyrotherapyduring the feverpeak occurring a few hours after the in-jection, urinary phosphorus (up) dis-appears entirely.  this fact cannot beaccounted for by the parallel decrease ingfr, because serum phosphorus level(sp) does not increase (as it would beexpected to, should retention occur) buton the contrary, it, too, declines to amarked degree.the possibility that changes in sp andup could have been brought about by anincreased utilization of glucose was alsoconsidered.  an intravenous glucose toler-ance test (method of macho and licko(8)) was carried out in another group ofpatients on control days and on days ofpyrotherapy five hours after the pyrogenadministration.  an increase in the rate of"glucose utilization" was observed(table 2).  however a different opinion isfound in the literature.  in the course ofglucose tolerance tests, conn (3) andcomparini (9) observed a lowered rate ofglucose utilization in febrile subjects.malizia (10) found an accentuated rateof decline of serum phosphorus duringglucose tolerance tests in subjects withhigh temperatures, but the glycemicresponses did not differ from those ob-tained when controls without fever weresubjected to the same tests.  whether itbe for utilization purposes or not, thefact remains that a massive transfer ofphosphorus from the serum into thetissues takes place in fever.

experimental studies on cerebrospinalfluid flowa mixed suspension of kaolin and lyco-podium was injected into the cisterna magnaof dogs.  blockade of csf space was producedsuccessfully in 63 of 75 dogs; in 48 of the 63,ventricular dilatation of more than interme-diate degree was observed.in these hydrocephalic dogs experimentalshunting was performed either between thelateral ventricle and the lumbar cistern or be-tween the unilateral lateral ventricle and thecontralateral cerebral subarachnoid space.  uni-directional, steady csf flow averaged 0.15 ml. perhour in the cases of the former shunting,and the flow averaged 0.25 ml. per hour in thecases of the latter shunting.csf flow rate from the ventricle toward thecerebral subarachnoid space was larger whenintraventricular pressure was higher.  this in-crease in flow rate parallel to increasing pres-sure probably results from an increase in csfabsorption.  there seems to be an upper limitof the flow rate as the pressure is raised.transient reflux of csf flow was induced byjugular or abdominal compression.following intravenous administration of hy-pertonic solutions, csf flow rate decreasedparallel to the fall of csf pressure and re-gained the original value as the pressure wasrecovered.  when the pressure fell as low as50 mm. of water the flow almost stopped.

2406. profound hypothermiathe aim of hypothermia is protection of vitalcerebral structures from hypoxiaduring aneurysm repair; profound hypothermiais also valuable in operating oncertain cardiac defects which cannot be repairedeven with whole body perfusion.since the time needed for aneurysm repair oftenexceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12minutes without circulation afforded by surfacehypothermia of 29  to 30  c., theauthors have investigated the drew (open-chest)technic, the closed-chest method,and isolated cerebral perfusion.  the drew technicconsists of substituting twopumps for the heart while the patient's lungs actas the oxygenator.  because of itsdisadvantages (the large amounts of blood neededand the morbidity due to intra-cardiac cannulation and median sternotomy), aclosed-chest method was developed,using a mayo-gibbons vertical-sheet pump-oxygenatorto provide the perfusion andextracorporeal cooling without requiring thoracotomy.in cerebral perfusion, bloodis taken from one artery, pumped through a heatexchanger, and returned to anotherartery.  the authors describe anesthetic technics,offer comparisons of the threemethods, give instructions pertaining to the productionof hypothermia, and list theproblems encountered in the management of these cases.

effects of short term administration ofhysiological doses of human growth hormonein three patients with turner's syndromeh. e. sjobergthe effect of apparently physiological doses of human growth hormonewas investigated in three patients with turner's syndrome in short termmetabolic balance studies.  the subjects presented an abnormal sex chro-mosome constitution and an increased level of sulphation factor activityin serum.two dose levels of hormone were used, and there appeared an anabolicresponse to both.  no correlation with dose was obtained for any of theparameters used except for urinary magnesium, where the retention wasgreater with the higher dose.  the sulphation factor activity of serum in-creased during hormone administration in the one case studied in thisrespect.the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was within the normal range inthe two patients studied in this respect, and was not altered by growthhormone.all patients had an increased urinary excretion of creatine which atpresent cannot be explained.  the creatinuria diminished during growthhormone treatment.the mechanism behind the retarded growth is discussed.  it is suggestedthat a major factor might be a defect in the center for linear growth,i.e. the epiphyses that would make these less responsive to all the factorsnormally stimulating the growth processes in the epiphyseal zones.

histidinemiaa review of published reports ofhistidinemia indicates that this conditionhas a variability of clinical and biochemicalexpression.  three children with histidinemia,born of a consanguineous marriageare reported here.  they had blond hair,blue eyes, speech defects, mental retardation,and a peculiar eeg abnormality.  theyalso exhibited characteristic biochemicalfindings of the disease: elevated blood andurine histidine, increased urine imidazolepyruvicacid, and a sustained high rise inplasma histidine following an oral histidinetolerance test.  they did not, however, havethe reduction of skin histidine a-deaminaseactivity which has been observed in somechildren with this condition.  tests for determinationof heterozygotes in the familywere not successful.parental consanguinity and normal skina-deaminase activity set these children apartfrom other reported cases.  the first lendssupport to the hypothesis that histidinemiais inherited as an autosomal recessive trait;the second supports the idea that the genicfault which results in reduced histidine a-deaminase activity can be expressed to adifferent degree in different tissues.  thesechildren seem to represent a variant ofhistidinemia where liver histidase activity isreduced while skin histidase activity ispresent.

relationship of maximal tubular phosphatereabsorption to filtration rate in the doga maximal renal tubular rate of reabsorption of phos-phate (tmp) has been demonstrated in the normal dog.  inthe dog, as in the man, considerable variability in the tmpoften occurs.  while some of this variability remains unex-plained, a direct relationship between glomerular filtrationrate (gfr) and tmp can be demonstrated when the gfr isvaried over a wide range.  this relationship suggests thatglomerular intermittency may exist in the dog.

studies of the antihemophilic factor (ahf, factor viii) produced in vonwillebrand's disease.it has been confirmed that persons with autosomalahf deficiency (von willebrand'sdisease) produce large quantities ofahf when transfused with ahf-deficientplasma from persons with hemophilia a.this occurs despite the fact that'complementation' does not occur in vitro.  oneprediction from a model suggestingthat the x-locus for ahf is structural whilethe autosomal locus is regulatory isthat the ahf which appears in von willebrand'sdisease after transfusion will bestructurally normal.  the ahf obtained underthese conditions has been tested bymethods and the results fulfil the prediction.this may imply that the model iscorrect.  on the other hand, the prediction mayhave been fulfilled for otherreasons.  perhaps the wrong parameters wereexamined, or the large standarderrors of the tests masked a real difference.further tests are obviously neededbefore one can feel reasonably certain thatmutation of a regulatory gene is thebasis of von willebrand's disease.  an examinationof persons with sex-linked andautosomal ahf deficiency using an antibodyprepared against wild type ahf mightbe very illuminating.  also, transfusion studiesshould be carried out on personshomozygous for von willebrand's disease ifsuch persons can be found.  failureto obtain 'new synthesis' in a homozygote wouldthrow great doubt on a model whichimplies that the reduced ahf levels in vonwillebrand's disease heterozygotes isdue entirely to reduction in an effector substancewhich neutralizes the repressorof an x-chromosome operon directly codingthe ahf molecule.

clinical features of the alalies (russian).the term 'alalies' is applied to the variousstates of absence or insufficient developmentof speech in children, resultingfrom defective development or affectionsof the speech centers before the developmentof speech.  from the clinicalstudy it is possible to distinguish between severalforms: motor, sensory, andsemantic alaly with signs of amnesia.  thecauses are multiple: trauma, perinatalcerebral hemorrhage, inflammatory processes,metabolic disorders before thedevelopment of speech, and alimentary andtrophic disorders.  the alalies showvarying degrees of severity.  in most childrensuffering from alaly, neurologicalsigns can be demonstrated on the right side,an indication of the organic nature ofthe condition.  the presence of local symptomsin the various forms of alaly isoften associated with signs indicating involvementof adjacent regions of the cerebralhemispheres in the pathological processwhich would explain why the alaliesare often complex.  the character of the alaliesdepends on functional disordersresulting from the lesion in the frontal, anterior,motor, temporal or parietalregion of the dominant cerebral hemisphere.patients with alaly often show neuroticreactions, resulting from the disordersof the processes of inhibition and excitationof the cerebral cortex and the subcorticalformations.  early treatment ofthe alalies with drugs combined with logopedicand pedagogic measures gives good results.

hypopituitarism: a study of growthhormone and other endocrine functions.pituitary function was evaluated in 25 adults withevidence of hypopituitarism or enlargement of the sellaturcica.  growth hormone secretory function was measuredby radioimmunoassay of plasma samples takenbefore and after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in a standardizedtest of growth hormone reserve.  all patientsexhibited significant defects in growth hormone secretion,as indicated by the failure of this hormone to riseto normal levels in response to hypoglycemia.  the orderof frequency of hormonal loss was: growth hormone,gonadotropin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroidstimulating hormone.  no pattern of deficiency was characteristicfor any particular etiology of hypopituitarism.one patient with asymptomatic enlargement of the sellaturcica (accidentally discovered) had an isolated lossof growth hormone secretory capacity.  two patients inthe series demonstrated intrinsic deficiency of thyroidas well as pituitary secretion, and both had elevatedliters of antithyroid antibodies.  this study representsthe first direct evaluation, by radioimmunoassay ofgrowth hormone function in a series of hypopituitaryadults.  it demonstrates a remarkably high prevalenceof growth hormone loss, and suggests that the growthhormone response to hypoglycemia may be one of themost sensitive tests for the diagnosis of hypopituitarism.
