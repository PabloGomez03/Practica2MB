surgical palliation for lung cancerthe results of resecting incurable lung cancerin an effort to improve the terminal course of asmall number of patients are briefly presented.this is not a comparative study and no in-ferences or conclusions are justified regardingthe choice of this form of therapy as palliationin preference to other forms of palliative ther-apy; however we do believe that the terminalcourse of the patient with lung cancer is bene-ficially effected by removal of the primarytumor whenever this is technically feasible.

cancer chemotherapy by continuous intra-arterial infusion.  experienceof the veterans administration surgical adjuvant cancer chemotherapyinfusion study group.two hundred fifty-one patients with advancedcancer have been treated with 365courses of intra-arterial cancer chemotherapy.this technique and its complicationsand results are analyzed and discussed.objective response was obtained in57% of the patients treated.  the best resultswere obtained in epidermoid carcinomaof the head and neck and the poorestin primary brain tumors and intra-abdominaladenocarcinomas.  ten per centof all patients receiving at least 1 courseof therapy and available for evaluation obtainedworthwhile palliation for 6 or moremonths.  ten patients have had satisfactoryresults for periods of 12 to 28 months.it is concluded that arterial infusionchemotherapy may be of benefit inthe palliation of patients in whom other moreconventional methods have failed orare contraindicated.  the frequency of seriouscomplications suggests that at presentthis form of therapy should be used onlyby individuals and groups with specialinterest and experience in chemotherapy.much further study of this type of cancertreatment is needed and various areas ofinvestigation are suggested.

palliation by radiotherapythe purpose of radiotherapy in the managementof cancer of the lung is first to cure the disease;second, to prolong useful and comfortable exist-ence; and third, to provide comfort and relief ofsuffering to those who are symptomatic and in-curable.cancers of the lung vary quite widely in theirresponse to radiation.  those of glandular origin,the adenocarcinoma, are more often than not ofmodest susceptibility and sometimes quite resis-tant.  the very undifferentiated, the so-called oat-cell cancers, are often of exquisite sensitivity, re-sponding to irradiation almost like lymphomas.most cancer of the lung, however, is squamous-cellcarcinoma and as such may be considered to bemoderately radiosensitive in much the same orderof magnitude as squamous-cell carcinoma of theskin, cervix or larynx, and should, in theory, becurable by this means in the same degree.  unfor-tunately, this has to date not been found to betrue.  the reasons are principally two: first andforemost, by the time a diagnosis is made, cancerof the lung has more often than not, estimated at80% and more, spread beyond the site of origin,thus making cure by any effective means presentlyavailable unlikely.  second, the substrate in whichthe cancer grows, the lung, tolerates radiation lesswell than do the tissues which surround the highlyradiocurable epithelial cancers such as carcinoma ofthe skin, cervix, and larynx, thus making an un-favorable therapeutic ratio.

clinical experience with palliationof metastatic adenocarcinoma with5-fluorouracil chemotherapychemotherapy of solid tumors is becoming amore and more helpful therapeutic tool.  itis probable that within a few years chemother-apy will become firmly established as an ad-junct to the primary treatment of solid tumors.perhaps someday a cancerocidal chemical willbe devised that can actually act as antibioticsdo on bacteria.  for this reason it is importantfor all surgeons interested in the treatment ofcancer to try to keep abreast of the recent ad-vances in the field of chemotherapy.  surgeonsshould also begin to use some of the technics forpalliation of incurable patients so that whenthese drugs are added to the armamentarium ofprimary treatment of cancer, they will befamiliar with the various technics and the modeof actions of the drugs.5-fluorouracil (5-fu) has had extensive clin-ical use and has produced significant palliationin breast and colon cancers with about a thirdof these patients receiving palliation for five tosix months.

intra-arterial infusion emphasizing treatment of malignant neoplasms.this review of the english medical literaturesummarizes most of the significantpapers concerned with intra-arterial infusion.this technique of cancer therapy iseffective for palliation of many advanced primaryand recurrent cancer patients.head and neck cancer patients form the largestgroup of patients that have been treatedbecause of the easily accessible arteries.however, almost any involved organcan be infused by external approaches to thefemoral, brachial and common carotids.most oncolytic chemotherapeutic agents canbe given via the intra-arterial route atnotably increased dosages with the exceptionof 5fudr.  partial and complete regressionof many tumors can be obtained withpresent day chemotherapeutic agentsfor 1 or 2 mth.  the best therapeutic resultshave been in patients with head and neckand pelvic tumors.  currently infusion techniquesusing small mobile pumping unitspermit the patient to be ambulatory during courseof anti-tumor therapy.  complicationsfrom intra-arterial infusion are usuallyminor but serious complications dooccur such as embolic phenomena to the cnswith internal carotid infusion; aplasticbone marrow from drug toxicity, hemorrhagefrom tumor degeneration.  technicalcomplications of the infusion may not be lifethreatening but frequently prematurelyterminate the therapy.  continued interest inthis form of therapy appears inevitable.

chromosomal patterns in cancer patients during treatment .radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and throughshort-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can beassessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because ofthe large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the courseof treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variationsfrom the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structuralaberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grownprior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us todetermine the variation .stained preparations examined microscopically allow us to recognizethese abnormalities which are apparent before, during, and afterradiotherapy . the damage appears to be largely random in thechromosomes affected in the different cancers, and the specificaberrations differ from cell to cell . however, there does seem to besome correlation between the appearance of persistent aberrantchromosomes and their frequency . while the peak incidence or /plateau/may remain unchanged, the frequency may change .

chemotherapy of breast cancerthe majority of cancer patients who arereferred for chemotherapy are in far advancedstages of the disease.  the difficulty in deliver-ing an effective dose of an oncolytic agentto the involved areas may limit the results oftreatment unless the patient's tumor is an un-usually responsive one.  the variability in re-sponse between apparently similar cases ofcancer of the same cell type has become in-creasingly evident, and is as puzzling as thefact that 20 per cent of patients with breastcancer will live 5 years with no treatment.  thedecisions as to the choice between chemother-apy and hormone therapy, as well as to thechoice of the chemotherapeutic agent to beemployed, may be difficult.as experience increases, the usefulness ofchemotherapy in the treatment of cancer isbecoming increasingly apparent.  it also has be-come apparent that chemotherapy cannot beregarded as a curative procedure in advancedcancer even though an occasional patient ap-pears to have been cured.  however, the valueof the oncolytic agents in prolonging usefulsurvival time, ameliorating many of the dis-tressing symptoms associated with cancer, andproviding the physician with an extra tool fora positive program in the care of the cancerpatient is now established.

chemotherapy of metastatic gastro-intestinal cancer.cancer of the digestive tract is the commonestcause of death from neoplastic disease in the unitedstates.  a large number of patients with these forms ofincurable cancer may be candidates for specific anti-tumordrug therapy.  the criteria employed for the selectionof patients for systemic or regional chemotherapyare reviewed and methods of treatment are outlined.systemic chemotherapy, using fluorinated pyrimidines,the antifol, methotrexate, and the alkylating agent, cytoxan,has been found to be of significant practical valuein 10 to 30% of the patients receiving these anticancerdrugs.  protracted hepatic artery infusion chemotherapyin patients with primary and secondary hepatic neoplasmsand tumors of the biliary system has resulted inobjective tumor response and associated clinical benefitin 60% of the patients treated.  length of survival hasbeen prolonged in patients with advanced metastatic livercancer from primary tumors of the colorectum.  it isconcluded that systemic and regional cancer chemotherapy,in selected cases, has contributed to the practicalmanagement of patients with incurable cancer of thegastrointestinal tract.

266. immunology of the cancer cell: tumour-specific antigensafter a broad historical survey of immunologicalstudies of cancer, a review is givenof the evidence showing that antigens present innormal cells are missing from themalignant cells that arise from the same tissue.this evidence is considered in con-junction with the deletion hypothesis of carcinogenesis,and the author emphasizes,that in his view, the key event in carcinogenesisis enzymatic deletion.  antigenicgain and intensification in the course of spontaneous,chemical, and viral carcino-genesis is reviewed, together with experimentsdemonstrating the existence oftumour-specific antigens.  the question is thenposed: if tumours have specific anti-gens, why is evidence for their rejection so scanty?the occasional spontaneous re-gression points to host resistance but its raritysuggests that tolerance generallydevelops.  consideration is given to theapplication of immunological methods totherapy and although current achievementin this field is limited, new immunologicalstratagems might yet transform the picture.finally a plea is made for the integra-tion of the disciplines of immunology andcellular differentiation.  the prospect israised that through a synthetic and holisticapproach we might discover the suscepti-bility of the cancer cell to re-differentiationand re-recognition.

palliative radiation therapythe care of the patient with "incurable" cancer may bedirected by physicians of various backgrounds and per-suasions.  if this physician has little experience in suchcare, he is prone to be influenced by still prevalent atti-tudes of therapeutic futility or by equally unjustifiedpremature claims for widely publicized methods recent onthe scene.  surgery and radiation therapy remain thedominant treatment forces for the patient with cancer.  itis unfortunate that lack of demonstration of good radiationtherapy has led to unjustified condemnation of the methodrather than the user, with resultant loss to the patient'swelfare.  to obtain maximal benefit, radiation therapymust be allowed indications and contraindications like anytherapeutic modality.  these must be the responsibility ofthe therapeutic radiologist.  application of realisticallystringent indications and contraindications does not lessenuseful accomplishment, but avoids unnecessary morbidity,waste of time, money and effort, and delay in seekingsuitable treatment.

(1) emigration andmigration of lymphocytes from the explant,. (2) clustering oflymphocytes around /target/ cells,. (3) ameboid transformation oflymphocytes,. (4) lymphocytic congregation,. and (5) emperipolesis .criteria for these different lymphocytic activities have been amplifiedor introduced .findings of particular interest were..

1577. mode of action of selenium in relation to biological activity oftocopherolsdietary selenium at levels below 1 ppm has a partially beneficial effectupon nutritional muscular dystrophy but is ineffective or detrimentalat higher levels.  the role of selenium in improving the effectiveness ofvitamin e is due at least in part to the fact that dietary selenium increasesthe retention of the a-tocopherols, especially d-a-tocopherol.  this has beenshown by chemical determination of plasma tocopherols and also by tracing theactivities of tritiated tocopherols and selenium75 in serum and in variousfractions of serum proteins in chicks receiving these nutrients alone and incombination.  se75 and h3-a-tocopherol activities followed each other veryclosely in the serum proteins.  these studies indicated that vitamin e may becarried by a selenolipoprotein fraction associated with serum y-globulin.  thus,one biological role of selenium appears to lie in a selenium-containingcompound which acts as a carrier of vitamin e and which may function inabsorption, retention, prevention of destruction, and perhaps transfer acrosscell membranes of d-a-tocopherol, thereby enhancing its biological activityin the blood and perhaps in cells throughout the body.

labial supportive appliancethe patient with a repaired cleft lip and palate and an associateddisplacement and deficiency of the premaxilla presents problems whichmay be of concern to the plastic surgeon, speech pathologist, orthodontist,and prosthodontist.the upper lip may appear flat or retruded in relation to the lower lip.when maxillary anterior teeth are missing, either congenitally, naturally(as in the mixed dentition period), or because of neglect, the upper lipmay appear to be rolled under the premaxilla.  the lower lip usuallyassumes a characteristic 'pouty' appearance.this complex of tissue deformities also may be important in the articulationof speech sounds.  fricatives and plosives are difficult to producecorrectly because of the malposition of the lip.  there may be interferencewith direction of air current, contact of tongue to alveolar ridge, andnormal contact of lips.corrective procedures are designed to improve the labial profile and toestablish more normal relationships of intraoral structures.  theseprocedures, employed individually or in combination, may include othodonticmovement of maxillary segments, dental prosthesis, and cheiloplasty.another more recently developed adjunct involves autogenousosscous implantation in the cleft areas.

volkmann's ischaemiavolkmann's ischaemia is the name given to a sequenceof events originally described by volkmann in 1881.basically the condition consists of the replacement ofthe limb flexor muscles by fibrous tissue following injury orocclusion of the main arterial supply of blood to thesemuscles.  the condition is rare fortunately--mainly becauseof improved methods of prevention.  the flexor muscles ofthe toes are sometimes affected, but the commonest group ofmuscles so damaged are the flexor muscles of the forearm.total arterial occlusion to a limb for several hours usuallycauses frank gangrene; partial or total occlusion for shorterperiods may give rise to ischaemic contracture.  the muscles,being deprived of their blood supply, die and are sub-sequently replaced by fibrous tissue.  like all scars, the fibroustissue contracts, producing the complete picture ofvolkmann's ischaemic contracture.  the forearm is thin andwasted, and the fingers are held in flexion owing to theoverall shortening of the flexor muscles.  in severe cases, ifthe nerves are also affected or if the entire muscle mass isreplaced by fibrosis, the fingers may be totally paralysedas well.

epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) as a therapeutic agent based on 5years clinical experience.experience in the treatment of 744 patients withe-aca suggested that the use of the preparation is indicatedin the following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhagein association with delivery.  (2) acute systemicfibrinolysis in association with surgery.  it ismainly major operations on the thorax, pancreas, prostate,liver and genital organs that are complicated byfibrinolysis, but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur afterany operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis in patientswith cancer, particularly cancer of the prostateand pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicatingvarious disorders, especially leukaemia, livercirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote inthrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activityin the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduceblood losses following prostatectomy, especially if thetreatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopicallyclear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumaticinjury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia andother coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effectivewhether given orally or intravenously.  in stateswith increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity inthe urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day hasproved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug one.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function testswere observed, not even in cases receiving more than1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs ofintravascular coagulation in connection with e-acatherapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications after prostatectomy in patientstreated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.judging from the authors' experience in this materiale-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.

1835. the decrease of the steroids in the urine in the course of lung tb.(the therapeutic value of their increase after calciferol)quantitative determination of the urinarysteroids in 38 patients with extensive ul-cero-caseous pulmonary tb confirmedthat the 17-ketosteroids are always decreasedin these cases.  calciferol, in the formof one ampoule of vit.  d2 of 600,000 u.every 10 days, in combination with activetuberculostatic drugs, in the majority ofthe cases leads to an increase of theurinary 17-ketosteroids from 50 to 100% in 2mth.  it appears that the calciferolexerts its action through proteolysis; it stimulatesthe liquefaction and evacuation of thecaseous material.  this proteolytic effect isrelated to that of the mineralocorticoids,which are phlogistic and proteolytic sub-stances.  calciferol offers the advantageover these substances that it does not affectthe electrolytes and is well tolerated bythe organism.  for this reason, good resultsmay be expected from its administrationin cases of extensive pulmonary tb, inwhich the myc. tuberculosis has remainedsensitive to the administered tuberculosticdrugs but nevertheless does not proceedtowards recovery because of the marked caseouslesions.  in such cases calciferol treatmentleads to a rapid and pronounced decreaseof the radiological shadows, improves thegeneral condition and also modifies thesteroid metabolism rendered abnormal by the disease.

2953. the death of a parentin the case of depressive illnesses the deathof either parent prior to the child reach-ing the age of 15 seemed to be correlatedas a significant contributory factor.  withthis exception, statistical studies suggestthat it is the death of a mother in the first7 yr. of a child's life, as opposed to thatof a father, that is potentially an etiologi-cal factor for the future development ofpsychoses, delinquency and psychoneuroses.the case histories of 6 boys who had losttheir fathers were given.  in each instancethere was distinct evidence that the psychologicalsymptoms and behavioral disturb-ances were to be attributed in large measureto the effect of the death upon the child,and that in some cases the symptom choice wasto be correlated with specific cir-cumstances surrounding the death of the father.in some cases it was the unresolvedgrief reaction in the mother which helped toperpetuate the disorder in the child.  re-solution of this in the mother during therapyled to improvement in the child's func-tioning.  in other instances improvementoccurred especially when the child ceasedto be preoccupied with a close identificationwith the dead father.  those boys whowere involved most closely in their mother'sgrief reactions were the ones who weremost disturbed.  the brief treatment giventhese boys and their mothers appearedto be responsible for the considerableamelioration of symptoms that resulted.  ther-apeutic intervention is worthwhile,especially in those instances where there is anunresolved grief reaction in the mother.

3752. steroid excretion in early breast cancerpatients with advanced breast cancerwho subsequently fail to respond to adrenalec-tomy or hypophysectomy have beenfound to excrete abnormal amounts of theurinary metabolites of androgen andcortisol.  when similar measurements arecarried out on patients with early breastcancer, it is found that approximately halfthe cases presenting for mastectomy arealso excreting abnormal amounts of thesesteroids.  subsequent follow-up shows thatthese cases tend to have a poor progno-sis, and a trial had therefore been startedin which the abnormality is being cor-rected.  in addition, it seems possible thatthe deficiency in adrogen excretion mayprecede the onset of the disease.  thisproblem is being investigated in a trialinvolving urinary steroid estimations in5000 normal women.  the measurementsare being compared with the subsequentdevelopment of breast cancer.

insulin and protein metabolismthe present status of protein synthesis within cells hasbeen outlined.  protein is formed in the absence of insulin;the net formation of protein is accelerated by insulin.  theeffects of insulin on protein metabolism take place independentlyof the transport of glucose or amino acids into thecell; of glycogen synthesis; and of the stimulation of highenergy phosphate formation.  in the case of protein metabolism,as in certain studies on the pathways of glucose andfat metabolism, these observations reveal striking intracellulareffects of insulin in many tissues.  within mosttissues the effect of insulin appears to find expression predominantlyat the microsomal level.  incidentally, otherhormones which affect protein metabolism such as growthor sex hormones appear to act at the microsomes.  the factthat insulin exerts effects on protein metabolism at otherintracellular sites as well as the above independent effectsleads one to agree that its action consists of a stimulationof multiple, seemingly unrelated, metabolic events.the fact that an immediate effect of insulin on proteinsynthesis is independent of the immediate need for extracellularglucose or amino acids does not mean that thesustained functioning of cells is likewise independent.  thebiochemist is fully aware of metabolic defects in diabeteswhich are not altered by insulin in vitro, but which demandvarying periods of pretreatment of the animal.  it isalso known that in diabetes some proteins (enzymes) maybe deficient while others may be produced in excess in theabsence of insulin.it is suggested that the physician desires at least twokinds of relation between these fundamental studies and hispatients.  one is the possible relation of a deficiency of insulinaction to pathological processes in tissues which havenot as yet been examined by the methods described.  theother is the need for more accurate measurements of themetabolic disorder and its control than such things asurinary and blood glucose.  in developing such future improvements,the place of insulin in protein biosynthesismust be kept in mind.
