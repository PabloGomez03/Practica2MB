renal amyloidosis.. a biopsy study .the relationship of the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney tothe clinical picture is reviewed in 14 cases of renal amyloidosisdiagnosed by renal biopsy . the large percentage of patients who had thenephrotic syndrome (11 patients) probably reflects the criteria forrenal biopsy at this institution . the etiology of the amyloiddeposition did not seem to be clearly correlated with either the amountof amyloid deposition in the kidney or the severity of the clinicalrenal disease . all patients had deposits in the glomerulus, and theheavier the deposition the severer the renal disease . of 7 patients whohad biopsy of the bone marrow, all had abnormal types or numbers ofplasma cells . the age range in primary amyloidosis appeared to be aboutthe same as that in amyloidosis secondary to myeloma . amyloidosisshould be suspected in patients with proteinuria, the nephroticsyndrome, or renal failure .

2091. modern methods of treatment of visceral amyloidosis in patients withpulmonary tuberculosis (russian)the immediate and long-term results oftreatment during 1945-1962 of 414 patientswith pulmonary tuberculosis complicatedby amyloidosis were studied.  hormonal(corticosteroid) therapy is the pathogenetictreatment for visceral amyloidosis andis indicated in the proteinuric and earlyedema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis whenthe functional capacity of the kidneys andthe liver is still adequate.  in the azotemicphase of amyloidosis, hormonal (corticosteroid)therapy is not indicated, since itleads to rapid deterioration in the patient'scondition.  since hypoxemia is one of themain factors in the pathogenesis of amyloidosis,oxygen therapy is rational patho-genetic therapy for patients with pulmonarytuberculosis complicated by hypoxemiaand with symptoms of the proteinuric oredema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis(without ascites), in the form ofsubcutaneous introduction of oxygen or oxy-geno-peritoneum.  in patients withpulmonary tuberculosis surgical interven-tion on account of the main processis indicated only in the early stages of amyloi-dosis when pronounced functionaldisorders of the kidneys and liver are absent.  co-joint therapy using protein vitamins(particularly ascorbic acid), hormonal (corticos-teroid) preparations, oxygen anddesensitizing agents and elimination of all foci ofinfection is indicated in treatmentof pulmonary tuberculosis with even the earliestsigns of amyloidosis.

766. certain features of the haemogram in patients with pulmonary tuberculosiscomplicated by amyloidosis (russian)regression of amyloidosis in the early stagesseems possible and for this reasonrussian clinicians are exploring the possibilitiesof finding means of early diagnosisof this complication.  the author studied 300complete clinical blood analyses madein 60 patients, viz. 30 with chronic fibrocavernousand cirrhotic forms of tb com-plicated by amyloidosis and 30 with the same formsof tb without amyloidosis.  fromdetailed serial study of the haemogram in patientswith pulmonary tb it is possibleto diagnose associated amyloidosis of the internalorgans in its initial stage.  thepresence of amyloidosis of the internal organs canbe inferred from the followingchanges in the blood picture  (a) the appearance ofnormochromic and hypochromicanaemia in patients with various forms of tb (withthe exception of tb of the kidneys,intestinal tract or larynx, and of caseous lymphnodes), (b) progressive increasein the leucocyte count with a neutrophil shift tothe left not corresponding with aphase of quiescence of the main disease, (c) consistentlyhigh esr in the absenceof an active process, (d) thrombocytosis in the phase ofsubsidence of a flare-up,and also changes in the thrombocytic formula tendingtowards the appearance of de-generative forms and old and mature thrombocytes.

2701. the role of certain additional factors in the development of amyloidosis,and its prophylaxis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)in patients with chronic fibrocavernoustuberculosis of the lungs, any toxic-aller-gic side reactions to antibacterial therapy,chronic foci or infection and diseaseswith an allergic component can contributeto the development of amyloidosis.  theearly detection and clearing of chronicfoci of infection and effective measuresagainst even mildly pronounced toxic-allergicside reactions are of prime impor-tance in the prevention of amyloidosis.  theunsystematic and prolonged administra-tion of antibacterial preparations, along withtheir toxic side effects, tends to in-crease the incidence of amyloidosis in patientswith chronic fibrocavernous pulmon-ary tb.  individual constitutional factors areof great importance in the developmentof side effects.  side reactions to chemopreparations,in cases of hypofunction ofthe liver and kidneys and autonomicdysfunction promote the development of dys-trophic processes, as is confirmedby the high frequency of toxic-allergic reac-tions in patients with fibrocavernouspulmonary tb who later develop amyloidosis.the administration of desensitizing drugsto patients showing side reactions there-fore helps to prevent amyloidosis in casesof chronic fibrocavernous tb, and chemo-therapy should be automatically combinedwith the administration of desensitizingand stimulatory drugs in this class of case.

3535. electron microscopic study of six cases of human renal amyloidosisthis study is particularly concernedwith  (a) the basal membrane in the differentstages; and (b) the intercapillary spacesin the early stages.  the conclusions maybe put as follows  (1) the amyloid substanceseems to have a fibrillar structurefrom the start.  (2) when the walls of theperipheral capillary loops are thickenedby voluminous amyloid deposits, thehyaline aspect of the primitive basal membranepersists, but its structure is altered bythe presence of multiple amyloid fibrils.(3) on the other hand, in the initial stages,amyloid fibrils cannot be seen in the'lamina densa' of the basal membrane; theyonly appear on the epithelial and endo-thelial surfaces of the membrane.  this suggeststhat amyloidosis represents anabnormal precipitate of extrinsic origin, ratherthan a transformation 'in situ'of the basal membrane.  (4) in the very early stagesof amyloid infiltration into theglomeruli the fibrillar substance is found first inthe intercapillary spaces, onlylater does it reach the peripheral capillary walls.

7364. experimental amyloidosis in immunitymuch of interest in the mechanism ofexperimental amyloidosis as a result of theparenteral introduction of foreign proteinhas been centered around the nature ofthe links leading to cytological and biochemicalchanges in tissues and body fluids.some of the authors suggested that such linksmay be of immunological nature.there is however, no clear-cut proof eitherin favor of or against the theory of animmunological origin of amyloid.  sinceinjection of proteins during the perinatalperiod prevents an immune response whenthe animal is subsequently challengedwith the same antigen, the authors studiedamyloidosis caused by casein in micetreated after birth with this protein.  miceexposed soon after birth to casein ac-quire an immune tolerance to this antigen.this was demonstrated by the absenceof circulating antibodies as measured by thedisappearance of i-labeled caseinfrom the circulation and by means of passivehemagglutination tests with asciticfluids.  both tolerant and control animalsdeveloped amyloidosis to the same extent.the results imply that the pathogenesis ofamyloidosis does not rest upon a classicimmunological basis; they do not excludethe possibility, that the disease may bedue to some auto-immune process.

parathyroid function in chronic renal failure.  a statistical surveyof the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy.a collection has been made of 134 personal andpublished cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in whichadequate information was available concerning thepathological state of the bones.  measurements wereavailable of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, andblood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonateand plasma proteins in a representative sample.the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the wholeseries of 134 cases were not related reciprocally butwere correlated directly.  these data were further analyzedby allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups,according to the type of pathological lesions present inthe bones.  in one group there was evidence of defectivemineralization of skeletal tissues, in the form of eitherrickets or osteomalacia, and the plasma-calcium wasfound to be statistically sub-normal.  in the other groupthere was no primary defect of mineralization but thelesions of generalized osteitis fibrosa were present andthe plasma calcium was statistically normal.  there wasno significant correlation between the plasma levels ofcalcium and phosphate in either sub-group; and the plasmaphosphate was significantly higher in the group withthe higher plasma calcium levels.  the data indicate thatin patients with renal osteodystrophy, contrary to generalbelief, the plasma calcium varies independently of theplasma phosphate.  since these results imply differencesin parathyroid function among patients with azotemicosteodystrophy, a survey has also been made ofthe recorded parathyroid weights in chronic renal failure.generalized osteitis fibrosa and the accompanying normallevels of plasma calcium are associated with greaterparathyroid hypertrophy than is found in most casesof chronic renal failure or cases with defective mineralization.the various data are interpreted in relationto the known metabolic disturbances and natural historyof azotemic osteodystrophy.  by analogy with states ofsimple vitamin d deficiency, it is suggested that hypocalcemiaand relative unresponsiveness to the calcemicaction of parathyroid hormone are related to an acquiredresistance to vitamin d.  the group of cases with statisticallynormal plasma-calcium prove that the parathyroidglands can function effectively in some patientswith chronic renal failure, irrespective of the level ofthe plasma phosphate.  the size of the glands and theeffects of sub-total parathyroidectomy in patients of thisgroup suggest that the normal plasma calcium resultsfrom an increased production of parathyroid hormone.the more advanced renal failure in the normocalcemic,as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could meanthat the development of an effective degree of secondaryhyperparathyroidism is a function of the duration of therenal disease.  it seems likely that when the parathyroidresponse is sufficient to overcome the effects of the vitamind resistance it also entails the development of generalizedosteitis fibrosa, healing of the defect of mineralizationand increased liability to metastatic calcification.

renal factors in the pathogenesis of hypertensionrenal arteriography and other modern diagnostic procedures have providedthe means of establishing a close relationship between high blood pressure andrenovascular disease.  many of these cases are amenable to surgical cure.  atthe present time there is no single test for the definitive diagnosis of renalhypertension.  careful and intensive studies are mandatory in the selection ofcases suitable for surgery, since hypertension has many etiologic factors andinvolves many complex and sometimes obscure mechanisms.  aortography,intravenous urography and split-function tests are among the most importantmethods for definitive diagnosis and for the planning of appropriate surgicalprocedures.at operation, the most commonly observed cause of renal arterial con-striction in the elderly is atherosclerosis, whereas in younger patients it ishyperplasia of the intimal and muscular coats of the renal artery and itsbranches.  renovascular surgery may require a variety of technical procedures.in the successful cases there is a striking and permanent reduction in bloodpressure.the accuracy of blood pressure readings is emphasized, since hypertensionis usually discovered for the first time during the course of a routinephysical examination.

cell proliferationin experimental hydronephrosisand compensatory renal hyperplasiamitosis counts and autoradiographic counts of nuclei labeled withtritiated thymidine were made in the renal cortex of male rats in whichthe left ureter was ligated.  these were compared with correspondingcounts in the remaining kidney after left nephrectomy, and in sham-operated controls 24, 48 and 72 hours after operation.  the cortex ofthe kidney on the obstructed side showed a greater number of tritium-labeled nuclei and mitotic figures than in the kidney undergoing com-pensatory hyperplasia.  epithelial and interstitial cells responded simul-taneously on the obstructed side, whereas in the remaining kidney afternephrectomy, the epithelial response preceded a slight interstitial re-sponse by 48 hours.  the contralateral kidney in rats subjected toureteral ligation showed no response.we concluded that the early response of increased dna synthesisand cell division in the obstructed kidney was not mediated by humoralfactors; it was localized and probably had a different mechanism thanthe proliferative response occurring in compensatory renal hyperplasia.

experimentelle nierenvergroberung nach unilateralernephrektomie bei rattenuntersuchungen mit 3h-thymidinin this paper it is attempted to clarify certain questions as to the mechanismof compensatory renal hypertrophy by means of histological, cytological, andautoradiographical examinations in nephrectomy experiments on young and grownrats.  based on the results of this investigation the process of compensatoryrenal hypertrophy must be imagined as follows:as early as two hours after unilateral nephrectomy, a distinct increase of themitosis index without a simultaneous increase in dna-synthesizing cells wasobserved in the remaining kidney.  it is assumed that a cell division ofpolyploid cells is involved, which were in a prolonged premitotic rest phase.after a latent period of 48 hours, the dna-synthesizing cells and dividingcells start to increase.  the maximum of the regenerative processes is reachedbetween the 3rd and 4th day after nephrectomy.  twenty days after unilateralnephrectomy, the regenerative processes are largely concluded.all tubule sections participate in the compensatory renal hypertrophy.although the regenerative processes are most marked in the central section,one cannot speak of the development of an actual indifference zone in theregenerating kidney.in young test animals, compensatory renal hypertrophy is determined moreby mitotic cell division, in older test animals more by polyploidizationprocesses.the results of these investigations provide no certain indications for theassumption that amitotic nuclear divisions play a major part in compensatoryrenal hypertrophy.proliferation processes which in extent and localization run parallel to theregeneration of the parenchyma, are also observed in the cells of theconnective tissue of the renal vessels.

compensatory renal enlargementhypertrophy versus hyperplasiaafter unilateral nephrectomy in the mouse, the compensatory growthof the remaining kidney is characterized by an increase in rna andprotein synthesis within the first hour.  dna synthesis remains un-changed for about 18 hours and then rises to a maximum at 48 hours.  bythe end of the fifth day, when dna synthesis has passed its peak and isin decline, cellular hyperplasia has accounted for only one-fourth of theincrease in kidney weight.  thus it is shown that cell hypertrophy is boththe primary and the predominant response in the early phase of compen-satory renal enlargement.

the action of vasopressin in renal diabetes insipidus.as the water-retaining action of antidiuretichormone is eliminated in renal diabetesinsipidus, the steps in na transport canbe separately determined.  vasopressininduced a prompt increase in freewaterclearance and urinary volume, as wellas a delayed increase in sodium clearance.it is suggested that vasopressin bringsabout stimulation of sodium reabsorption inthe ascending limb of henle's loop.  itis supposed that both physiological actionsof antidiuretic hormone - the antidiureticand the sodium-active effect - become operativein two different places in the nephronand synergistically produce a maximumconcentration of urine.

renal renin in unilaterally nephrectomized hypertensive rats.juxtaglomerular index, renal pressoractivity and width of the zona glomerulosawere normal in unilaterally nephrectomizedhypertensive rats maintained on a normalsodium intake, increased in thosesubjected to sodium depletion and decreasedin those receiving 1% saline.  this indicatesthat renin formation and secretion aremost likely the result of the sodium stateof the animal rather than loss of a renin-stimulatingagent in the contralateral orunclipped kidney.  failure of sodium to influencethe degree of hypertension inunilaterally nephrectomized hypertensive ratsmilitates against a direct quantitativerelationship between blood pressure and therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

studies on compensatory renal hypertrophy.  i.  effect ofunilateral ureteral ligation and transectiondata are presented comparing the relative rateof compensatory renal hypertrophyand hyperplasia of the control kidney of ratsfollowing either unilateral ureteraltransection, ligation, or nephrectomy.  the growthof the control kidney on the unoperatedside was strikingly slower after ureteraltransection and ligation whencompared with that resulting from the removalof one kidney.  progressive hydronephrosiswas observed on the operated side followingureteral transection andligation and was more pronounced in the latter.degree of hypertrophy of the controlkidney showed a close correlation with degree andduration of the hydronephrosis ofthe kidney on the operated side.  these observationshave been interpreted as indicatingthe operation of a control system regulatingkidney growth in response tochanges in some way related to kidney size.

the role of age and x-irradiation on kidneyfunction in the mousefemale mouse kidneys show a decline with respect to age in the ability toconcentrate the urine during a 24-hour water fast.  x-irradiation early inlife has no measurable long-term effect on this process.kidney cortex slices of old female mice can concentrate p-aminohippuricacid against a concentration gradient equally as well as slices from youngmice.  there is no loss in this ability by cortex slices from young or oldfemale x-irradiated mice.it is uncertain whether compensatory renal hypertrophy after unilateralnephrectomy declines with age in nonirradiated mice.  x-irradiation doescause a reduction in the degree of compensatory renal hypertrophy in the agingmouse.  this reduction may represent a loss in the ability of kidney cells toundergo cell division.the administration of testosterone propionate to old mice during compen-satory renal hypertrophy results in an increased hypertrophy.  the increase isrelatively the same for irradiated and nonirradiated mice, indicating the lackof a long-term effect of x-irradiation to reduce the ability of a targetorgan to respond to a hormone.the over-all conclusion of this study, with respect to "radiation-inducedaging," is that x-irradiation of the female swiss mouse early in life does nothave a pronounced effect on kidney function late in life but may have a long-term effect on those processes concerned with cell division.

localization of phosphaturic effect ofparathyroid hormone in nephron of the dogthe renal mechanism and tubular site of the phosphaturic action ofparathyroid hormone were investigated by clearance and stop-flowtechniques in one intact and seven thyroparathyroidectomizeddogs.  administration of hormone caused a significant increasein the excretion of phosphate without increasing the filteredload.  stop-flow analysis indicated that in the absence of parathyroidhormone most of the filtered phosphate was reabsorbedin the proximal tubule, and that the hormone increased therate of phosphate excretion by inhibiting this reabsorptivemechanism.  p32 injected during stopped flow showed no significanttransport across the renal tubule despite the presence ofexcess parathyroid hormone.  significant p32 activity appearedin the stop-flow collections simultaneously with the appearanceof new filtrate.  there was no evidence that parathyroid hormonemediated a secretory process for phosphate excretion.

effects of hypophysectomy and growth hormone on renal compensatoryhypertrophy in rats.the effect of hypophysectomy on renal compensatoryhypertrophy (rch) was observed in unilaterallynephrectomized rats receiving no therapy and thosereceiving replacement therapy and was compared to therch attained by non-hypophysectomized unilaterallynephrectomized rats at 2, 5, and 10 days.  in the lattergroup there was an initial rapid rch seen at day 2which continued, but at a slower rate, through day 10.in the hypophysectomized group without replacementtherapy there was also an initial rch in the first 48 hrs.however, instead of the rch continuing there was aregression in kidney size at 5 days and with no subsequentchange at 10 days.  in the hypophysectomized groupreceiving hormone replacement there was an initialrch comparable to the other 2 groups, but the furtherrenal enlargement at 10 days was much less than thatof the non-hypophysectomized animals.  the results ofthis experiment and of other reported studies implyexistence of a renotropic factor which is not producedin the pituitary, but which requires an intact pituitaryfor full effectiveness.

cell proliferation in compensatory renal growthrats with one kidney removed showed a progressive increase in weight of theremaining kidney over a six-week period.autoradiographic and radiochemical studies with 3h-thymidine indicated that theincrease in new kidney cell formation was maximal forty-eight to seventy-twohours after unilateral nephrectomy.  this early response was chiefly due to theproduction of new cells by the renal cortical tubules.  normal rates of tubulecell turnover were achieved two weeks after operation.  the glomerular tuftscontained fewer new cells and their peak production was delayed to theone-week period with a slow decline thereafter.rats forty-eight hours after unilateral nephrectomy were chosen as a model tostudy the effect of various substances on the magnitude of new cell formation.the number of dna-synthesising cells in the stimulated kidney was reduced bytreatment with hydrocortisone, acth, 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, and1,2-benzanthracene; the numbers were increased by the administration ofdeoxycorticosterone and aldosterone.

role of the liver in the glycoprotein mobilizing property ofparathyroid extractstudies were carried out to de-termine the action of hepatectomy on theglycoprotein action of pte as well as onpte-induced renal calcification and deposi-tion of glycoprotein.  our data showed thatin hepatectomized rats, pte no longer causedan elevation in serum glycoproteins.  how-ever, hepatectomy did not alter the forma-tion of glycoprotein tubular casts producedby pte administration.  the data suggestthat the liver is the major source of the ele-vated serum glycoproteins found in rats re-ceiving pte.  in addition, it is possible thatpte may have a direct stimulating actionon biosynthesis of glycoprotein by the kidney.

pathogenesis of polycystic kidneysmicrodissection confirms our previous de-scription of an uncommon variety of poly-cystic kidney found only in the newbornperiods.  it is characterized by symmetricalenlargement caused by saccular or cylindri-cal increase in size of all collecting tubules.the number and relative length of differentgenerations of collecting tubules are normal.nephrons are present in normal numbers,and their attachment to collecting tubules isnormal.  the pattern of the nephrons is nor-mal except for minimal localized areas ofdilatation.  interstitial connective tissue isnot increased.  intrahepatic bile ducts are in-variably cystic.  siblings may be affected.we believe that in such kidneys the be-havior of the ampullae of the branches of theureteral bud is normal and that secondaryhyperplasia of the interstitial portions of thebranches is responsible for the greatly in-creased renal size.

polyuria in children.twelve polyuric children have been investigated inthe present report from their etiologico-clinical aspectand they have been classified into four broad groups.  thefirst group of diabetes insipidus syndrome included 4cases - 3 of idiopathic type and one of the acquired varietydue to hand-schuller-christian-disease.  the 4 casesin the second group of nephrogenic diabetes insipidusafter further investigations were diagnosed as renalacidosis (1 case), other renal tubular syndromes withmultiple defects (2 cases), and hypokalaemic nephropathy(1 case).  the third group of polyuria due to chronic renalfailure has been exemplified by one case.  the fourthgroup of 3 cases had compulsive water drinking as theprobable etiology.  in addition to the illustrative casehistories, a practical diagnostic approach in the contextof physiopathology of normal urine excretion has been recommended.

hemorrhagic episodes in hemophilia: a 5-year prospective study.medicosocial studies of hemophilia are ofparticular clinical importance in allowing an assessmentof the likely course of the disease at differentages and for differing grades of severity, and inproviding knowledge of which complications causethe most disability, loss of education, and earningcapacity.  they also overcome the distorted clinicalimpression of the disease which arises from therecurrent admission of the same few severely affectedhemophiliacs.  owing to the considerable individualvariation in the number and severity of complicationsin different hemophiliacs an accurate individualprognosis can never be given.  in general,however, the number of spontaneous episodes peryear decreases with age, while the severity of individualepisodes tends to increase, at least untilthe age of 21 yr.  there is general agreement thatthe bulk of hospital hemophilic admissions are dueto hemarthroses and that hemophilic arthropathyinvolves the knee more than it does any other joint.the increased time spent in hospital per episode inlater life is in part at least due to the developmentof relatively unstable weight-bearing joints due tohemophilic arthropathy and associated muscle atrophy.thus the correct management of individualhemarthroses in childhood is of considerable importance,and at the present time too little is knownof the best possible treatment for these episodes.little is known of the pathological mechanisms ofhemophilic arthropathy and whether it is the presenceof blood or its presence under tension whichleads to joint destruction.  thus opinions differ concerningthe routine admission of all hemarthrosesto hospital regardless of severity and also about theadvisability of joint aspiration in an attempt to avoidthe development of destructive arthropathy.  becauseof the individual variation between patients, thechanges in the pattern of the disease with age, andthe difficulty of obtaining suitable control patientsthese questions can be answered only by furtherlongterm prospective medicosocial studies.

the action of oral diureticsin diabetes insipiduschronic administration of chlorothiazide andother thiazide analogues in diabetes insipidusresults in a striking reduction in urinary volumewith increase in urinary osmolality.  this curiousantidiuretic action was first described bycrawford & kennedy (1959), and though it hassince been widely confirmed in both the pituitaryand nephrogenic forms of the disease, its precisemechanism remains obscure.  a number ofinvestigators have sought to explain the phenom-enon entirely on the basis of the renal actions ofthese drugs (earley & orloff 1962, goodman &carter 1962), whilst others have contended thatabatement of polyuria may be secondary to acentral effect of the thiazides in decreasing thirst(robson & lambie 1962, skadhauge 1963).over the past two years, we have conducteddetailed in-patient studies of the action ofvarious diuretic drugs of the thiazide and otherseries in a group of 7 patients with pituitarydiabetes insipidus.

extrarenal fibromuscular hyperplasia.clinical, radiologic, and pathologic studies on19 patients with lesions in the extrarenal arteries thatresembled fibromuscular hyperplasia are described.in 11 patients fibromuscular hyperplasia was presentin the renal arteries.  patients with involvement of theceliac artery were the only ones who had symptoms ofvisceral ischemia.  fibromuscular hyperplasia of theinternal carotid arteries was observed in 6 patients, 2of whom had symptoms of cerebral ischemia.  nine patientswith fibromuscular hyperplasia of the carotid orrenal arteries had intracranial aneurysms, and in 2others intracranial hemorrhage developed in the absenceof demonstrable aneurysms.  the histologic similaritiesbetween intracranial aneurysms and othertypes of aneurysms that appear in patients with fibromuscularhyperplasia, the frequency of intracranialaneurysms in patients with extracranial fibromuscularhyperplasia, and the similar sex and age incidence suggesta common etiologic origin.

2469. the nature of collagen disease, particularly of systemic lupuserythematosus (sle), with special reference to renal lesions (japanese)from the results of examination of 161 autopsy cases of collagen diseases,rheumatic fever and polyarteritis nodosa (pn) are considered as diseases ofhyperergic nature, showing pronounced specific manifestation in particularorgans.  as the reactivity becomes lower, this specific localization becomesless significant and many organs become affected in sle.  it may accordingly besupposed that sle is not a disease of hypersensitivity but one occurring ina state of exhaustion of reactability after prolonged sensitization.  moreover,a sle-like syndrome arises not only in the end stage of parasepsis, nephritis,nephrosis and some cases of prolonged sensitization by myco.tb but also inpn,pss,dm and rheumatism.  it may therefore be conceivable that sle isa syndrome rather than a separate entity.  it is most important to considerwhether sle-like symptomatology may be regarded as a process equal toan auto-immunization and whether the key to morphological elucidation of theauto-immune phenomenon may lie hidden in this problem.

the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney and thezona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex inthe sodium losing and the hypertensiveforms of virilizing adrenalhyperplasiapathological and biochemical observationsare presented in two cases of virilizing ad-renal hyperplasia: one of the sodium-losingtype and the other of the hypertensive type.examination of the kidneys revealed hyper-trophy of the juxtaglomerular cells in thecase exhibiting excessive sodium loss.  theadrenal cortex showed hypertrophy of thezona glomerulosa.  it is hypothesized thatthe chronic state of sodium loss causedchanges in the intravascular compartmentwhich led to compensatory activity of thejuxtaglomerular cells with resultant stimula-tion of the zona glomerulosa.examination of the hypertensive case(known to involve a different enzyme defi-cit) showed hypertrophy of the zona glom-erulosa without hypertrophy of the juxta-glomerular cells.  the intrinsic overproduc-tion of sodium-retaining steroids associatedwith the genetic defect in this clinical formcould account for both the hypertensionand the absence of hypertrophy of the juxta-glomerular apparatus.

studies on the sweat in renal diabetes insipidus duringtreatment with saluretics.description of a 5-month-old boy sufferingfrom familial diabetes insipidus.  hissweat as well as that of his mother had anincreased nacl content.  chlorthalidoneand fursemide had a different effect bothon the quantity and on the nacl content ofthe sweat.  a single dose of chlorthalidonedecreased the nacl content for a shorttime, but increased the quantity of sweatduring 3 days.  fursemide given intermittentlyproduced a decrease of the sweat naclalso during the intervals and an increaseof the quantity of sweat; however, as acontraregulation during the intervals, thequantity of sweat decreased and at the sametime the urea content increased.  fromthe isotonic serum filtrate in the sweatglands ho and nacl were reabsorbed inthe ducts and the urea concentrationincreased but the reabsorption of ho and nacldid not go parallel, therefore the sweat ishypotonic.  this regulation is altered indiabetes insipidus, therefore the high valuesof nacl.  without changing the osmolarity,na is exchanged with k.  this mechanismis accentuated if the na-concentrationis high.

the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on water intakeand plasma osmolality in diabetes insipidus inthe rata fall in plasma osmolality accompanied the reduction of urine volume inrats with hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, given hydrochlorothiazide and anotherwise normal diet.  the plasma concentration was not reduced with ahigh sodium intake, although urine volume still fell.  normal rats and hypo-thalamic obese rats increased their water turnover after hydrochlorothiazide,yet their plasma concentration fell.  moreover the antidiuretic response tovasopressin, which is purely renal, was also accompanied by plasma dilution;although it is self-evident that rats which drink less are less thirsty, thereduction in thirst after hydrochlorothiazide may not be a direct result of thechange in plasma osmolality.as previously shown in patients (kennedy and hill, 1963) a high sodiumintake increased free water clearance in diabetes insipidus but did notinterfere with the reduction of polyuria by hydrochlorothiazide, whereas a highpotassium intake reduced free water clearance and prevented any effect of thedrug on urine volume.

2476. studies on cardiac dimensions in intact,unanesthetized man. i. description of techniques and theirvalidation. ii. effects of respiration. iii. effects ofmuscular exercisea method is described which permitsmeasurement of relative changes in the exter-nal dimensions of individual cardiacchambers throughout the cardiac cycle in intact,unanaesthetized man.  it consists ofsuturing multiple radiopaque silver-tantalumclips to the surface of the heart at thetime of cardiac operations.  in the postopera-tive period, cineradiograms areobtained and the distances between clips are mea-sured on each individual frame.this technique has been found to be safe and hasbeen employed in 68 patients withoutany complications.  as a result of studies in 8patients utilizing biplane serial exposures,the effects of rotation of the heart in thesagittal plane during the cardiac andrespiratory cycles were determined precisely.if clips were properly placed on the heart,the possible errors resulting from suchrotation were found to be quite small.during inspiration right ventricular dimen-sions increased, while the opposite occurredduring expiration and during the val-salva manoeuvre.  left ventricular dimensionsexhibited little change during normalrespiration.  during deep, slow inspiration,the changes in dimensions of the leftventricle lagged behind those of the rightventricle by 1 to 5 (generally 2 or 3) car-diac cycles; the magnitude of the changes inthe dimensions of the left ventricle wassmaller than that which occurred in the rightventricle.  the effects on ventriculardimensions of light muscular exercise performedin the supine position were studiedin 9 patients.  the end-diastolic dimensionsdecreased by an average of 6.0% of con-trol in the right ventricle, and by an average of5.1% in the left ventricle.  end-sys-tolic dimensions decreased by an average of 5.6%of control in the right ventricleand by an average of 6.5% in the left ventricle.these decreases are considered toapproximate one-half of the resting stroke volume.in the 4 patients in whom therate of right ventricular pressure rise was determinedcontinuously, exercise re-sulted in an elevation of dp/dt while ventricularend-diastolic dimensions decreased.these data are interpreted to indicate that anincrease in myocardial contractilityoccurs during muscular exercise in man.

hemophilic arthropathyjaromir priborsky, zora antalovskathe authors report their experience with jointdiseases in 54 patients suffering from hemo-philia, 49 of them being cases of hemophilia a,5 of hemophilia b.  21 patients were childrenup to the age of 14 years.  bleeding into the jointsoccurred in 66.6% of patients.  in the agegroup over 14 years the cases of bleeding intothe joints were more frequent (78.8%) thanin the age group up to 14 years (47.7%).there were no differences as to bleeding into thejoints and the seriousness of articular changesbetween the cases of hemophilia a and hemo-philia b.  in most cases the bleeding into thejoints began between the 6th and the 14th yearof age.  bleeding into the joints as the firstmanifestation of a hemophilic condition occurredonly in 9.3% of patients; in most cases otherhemophilic manifestations preceded.  in spite ofthis fact the joint manifestations were oftenwrongly diagnosed as tuberculous arthritis, rheumaticfever, progressive arthritis, and were treatedaccordingly.  most usually the large joints (knee,elbow, ankle) were affected with bleeding and inthem the changes were also the most serious.  thejoints of both halves of the body wereaffected uniformly.  in most cases several joints wereaffected while monoarticular localizationwas observed in 16.6%.  the seriousness of articularchanges was dependent mainly on thenumber of repeated bleedings into one and the samejoint, although other factors (weight bearingof the joint, complexity of the joint, treatment) may beof decisive importance in the individualcases as well.according to clinical (especially fromthe functional point of view) and x-ray criteria thearticular findings were classified into threegroups: in the first group the function of the jointis preserved, in the second limited andin the third practically extinguished.  the followinglaboratory tests were carried out: erythrocytesedimentation reaction, latex test for the rheu-matoid factor, c-reactive protein, mecoproteintyrosine and weltmann's coagulation test.the findings were normal even in cases ofirreparable articular changes unless acute bleedinginto the joint or in some other localization,or some other complicating disorder was presentsimultaneously.the therapy of hemophilic arthropathyremains troublesome owing especially to a frequentoccurrence of articular bleeding.a close cooperation of the hematologistand the rheumatologist or the orthopedist may con-tribute to the improvement of the fate ofthese patients.

epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) as a therapeutic agent based on 5years clinical experience.experience in the treatment of 744 patients withe-aca suggested that the use of the preparation is indicatedin the following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhagein association with delivery.  (2) acute systemicfibrinolysis in association with surgery.  it ismainly major operations on the thorax, pancreas, prostate,liver and genital organs that are complicated byfibrinolysis, but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur afterany operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis in patientswith cancer, particularly cancer of the prostateand pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicatingvarious disorders, especially leukaemia, livercirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote inthrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activityin the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduceblood losses following prostatectomy, especially if thetreatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopicallyclear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumaticinjury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia andother coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effectivewhether given orally or intravenously.  in stateswith increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity inthe urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day hasproved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug one.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function testswere observed, not even in cases receiving more than1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs ofintravascular coagulation in connection with e-acatherapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboemboliccomplications after prostatectomy in patientstreated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.judging from the authors' experience in this materiale-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.

chemical aspects of compensatory renal hypertrophythe effect of unilateral nephrectomy on the size and composition of theremaining kidney has been investigated in rats.  in normal rats the rightkidney is, on the average, significantly heavier than the left and has ahigher total content of dna and rna.  the 2 kidneys have almost identicalratios of rna/dna and protein/dna.  after unilateral nephrectomy the survivingkidney increases steadily in wet and dry weight for the 1st 4 days after theoperation.  this is accompanied by a much slower increase in total dnacontent and by a dramatic increase in rna/dna ratio.the rna/dna ratio in kidney is also affected by diet, being higher on ahigh-protein than on a low-protein intake.  moreover, the rise in rna/dnaratio that follows unilateral nephrectomy is greater in animals fed ahigh-protein diet.  the changes in kidney weight and in total contents of dna,rna, protein, and lipid phosphorus resulting from the feeding of a high-proteindiet were found to be of approximately the same magnitude as those in theremaining kidney 4 days after unilateral nephrectomy.  the rna/dna andprotein/dna ratios are also greater in rats fed a diet containing 10% urea,but the increase is much less than that in the remaining kidney afterunilateral nephrectomy.

the effect of actinomycin d on parathyroid-inducedchange in bone and kidney.actinomycin d (amd), an antibiotic known toinhibit dna-directed rna synthesis,was used to study parathyroid-induced changesin ca mobilization in vivo and in vitroas well as renal excretion of ca and phosphatein rats.  intact and parathyroidectomizedrats subjected to peritoneal lavage wereadministered amd, and changes inca, p, and mg in lavage and serum wereexamined.  amd consistently lowered theca transfer into the peritoneal rinse in boththe intact and parathyroidectomized animals,although the drop in ca was more acuteif the animals were pretreated by subcutaneousinjections of amd than if amd wasadministered as a component of therinse.  pretreatment of lavaged animals withamd prevented the expected increasein osteoclast numbers in the distal metaphysisof the femur but had no effect if administeredas a component of the peritoneal rinse.the incubation of femora removedfrom both intact and parathyroidectomizedanimals resulted in media ca levels thatwere significantly lower after 4 hr. incubationwhen amd was added in vitro.  however,transfer of recently injected ca intothe incubation medium from animalstreated with amd was increased.  in addition,parathyroidectomy of animals subsequentto administration of amd still resultedin expected changes in ca and p in theurine although amd significantly increased pexcretion in both intact and parathyroidectomizedanimals.  it was concluded thatendogenous parathyroid hormone requiresthe continuous production of enzymes ultimatelyresponsible for its action on boneand kidney, but that this action is not necessarilyrelated directly to the productionof m-rna.
