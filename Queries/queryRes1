465. conversion of a-crystallin of bovine lens into insolubleprotein in vitroa-crystallin can be converted into an insolubleform by treatment with alloxan andto a very small extent with iodoacetate.other reagents such as hcl, naoh, reducedglutathione, hydrogen peroxide,mercaptoethanol, were not able to convert a-crys-tallin into an insoluble form.  thealloxan treated insoluble a-crystallin could be madesoluble by treatment with 7 m urea.the product thus made soluble had the sameelectrophoretic mobility as a-crystallin,but showed cross reaction with a-crystallinin ouchterlony plate and did not haveproteolytic activity.  alloxan was effective inproducing cataract of rabbit lens when verysmall amounts were injected into theaqueous.

the insoluble proteins of bovine crystalline lens .the insoluble lens proteins, the albuminoids, of the adult bovine lenscortex can be rendered soluble by raising the ph of their washedsuspension in 0.9 nacl to 10.5 and then reducing it again to ph 7.4 .the sedimentation constant of the dissolved protein is 10.8 s,. itsmolecular weight is estimated to be 360,000 12,000 . the amino acidcomposition is approximately the same as that of the soluble -crysta-llin fraction, a kinship which is also apparent from their immunochemi-cal properties . it is suggested that the initial insoluble protein is amolecular aggregate of -crystallin, which is dissociated in alkalinesolutions to molecules exhibiting a sedimentation constant of 10.8 s .

1747. the problem of albuminoidalbuminoid is the main constituent of theinsoluble fraction of the lens proteins.albuminoid from the cortex of ox lens hasbeen fractionated on deae-cellulose in7 m urea; peptide maps of the fractionsare very similar to those from the corre-sponding fractions from a-crystallin.albuminoid can be regarded as an insolublea-crystallin.  an undiluted ground lensis clear but becomes turbid on dilution.  ifalbuminoid is present in the normal lens,it does not cause turbidity even when thecellular structure is disrupted.  it isperhaps more likely that the albuminoid isformed on dilution of the lens mush.the high concentration of proteins in the lens,especially in the nucleus, entails a highdegree of order, which will be destroyedon dilution  this phenomenon may well beconnected with the precipitation of thealbuminoid.

posterior scalloping of vertebral bodies in uncontrolled hydrocephalus.two cases of extensive posterior scallopingof the vertebral bodies are presentedin men aged 17 and 23 years, havinglong-standing hydrocephalus.  twoadditional cases with scalloping of only onelumbar vertebra when partially controlledhydrocephalus has been present for a shortertime are also noted.  no previousassociation between these entities has beenrecorded.  it is supposed that the increasedintraspinal pressure which must havebeen present in the first 2 patients formany years, was present near the time ofclosure of the epiphysis at the junction ofthe arch and the bodies and caused not onlywidening of the spinal canal but alsoexcavation of the vertebral bodies.  scallopingof vertebral bodies has been describedin: (1) neoplasms (neurofibromas,meningiomas, gliomas, hemangio-endotheliomas,hemangiomas, lipomas): (2) intraspinalcysts (intradural arachnoid cysts,tarlov's perineural cysts, thoracic extraduralcysts in kyphosis dorsalis juvenilis):(3) congenital anomalies of the spine andcord (fusion defects, myelodysplasia,hydromyelia, absence of a single vertebralpedicle, meningoceles): and(4) neurofibromatosis (with or without a thoracic meningocele).

1972. structural studies of a-crystallina-crystallin has been isolated from the cortexof ox lens by isoelectric precipitationfollowed by chromatography on deae-cellulose.the amino acid composition is inagreement with that reported for a-crystallinprepared by a different method.  thereis one thiol group/20,000g. of protein(20,000 is the order of magnitude of the sub-unit molecular weight), and disulphidebonds are absent.  the thiol group has beenalkylated with radioactive iodoacetatein the presence of urea.  partial acid hydroly-sis of the alkylated protein gives,according to the conditions, mainly 3 radioactivepeptides or nearly exclusively oneradioactive dipeptide.  the dipeptide is n-seryl-(s-carboxymethyl) cysteine, ser-cmcys.the 2 other peptides are probably the tri-peptides related to ser-cmcys.  thesimplest interpretation of these results is thatthe sequence around the cysteine residueis a common structural feature of the sub-units of a-crystallin.

3105. studies on the subunits of a-crystallin and their recombi-nationearlier investigations have shown that, inthe presence of high concentrations ofurea, a-crystallin from bovine lens is splitinto a number of subunits with apparent-ly different electrophoretic mobilities butsimilar molecular weights.  the recom-bination of these subunits after removal ofthe urea has been studied by ultracentri-fugation and immunoprecipitation techniques.it was found that maximal recombina-tion was obtained when the ionic strengthduring the removal of the urea was high(>0.2), whereas at low ionic strengths amolecule with only half the molecular weightof native a-crystallin and a much lowersedimentation coefficient was obtained.  acomplete recovery of the structure ofnative a-crystallin was never obtained, evenat high ionic strengths, as was evidentfrom electrophoretic and quantitative preci-pitin analyses.  the subunits werefractionated by chromatography on deae-cellu-lose in the presence of 7 m urea.the purification was followed by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis.  after removal ofthe urea at high ionic strength, 2 of thefractions obtained showed reactions ofonly partial identity with native a-crystallinin immunodiffusion tests, but all otherfractions showed complete identity.  thedifferences in the electrophoreticmobilities of the fractions in the presence ofurea persisted after removal of the urea.all fractions had much higher sedimen-tation coefficients in the absence of ureathan in its presence, although the valuesfor urea-treated unfractionated a-crystallinobtained after removal of the ureawere not reached even at high ionic strengths.the amino acid composition of thefractions was found to differ.  theseobservations suggest that a-crystallin is com-posed of a number of chemically different,but related, subunits of approximatelythe same size, which are bound togetherby nonspecific, noncovalent bonds, pos-sibly hydrophobic bonds.  moreover,when isolated, these subunits have the abilityto associate and form molecules ofhigh molecular weight.

1745. the deaggregation of bovine lens a-crystallinsedimentation equilibrium studies of lensa-crystallin at neutral ph indicate thatthis material is composed of a numberof different sized species.  a study of theeffect of alkali upon a-crystallin indicatesa progressive deaggregation of the ma-terial with increasing ph.  sedimentationequilibrium studies were performed at ph12.8 as well as in guanidine hydrochloride,7 m urea, and with succinylated material.under all of these conditions a molecularheterogeneity was observed.  the dataindicate that independent species coexistedunder most dissociating conditions.  theweight average molecular weights of thesuccinylated, and of the alkali-, urea-,and guanidine hydrochloride-treatedmaterial were found to have an integral relation-ship of 8 4 2 1, respectively.  since aconstant ratio of m2 mw was found, it wasconcluded that the same spread ofdistribution of molecular species occurred foreach of the deaggregating conditions.the results in guanidine hydrochloride couldnot be evaluated in this manner becauseof a small concentration dependence.  theseconclusions imply that not only theweight average molecular weight in 7 m ureabut the actual molecular weight ofeach individual species in urea was one-half ofthe value to be found in alkali andone-quarter that of the succinylated material.

lens development.. the differentiation of embryonic chick lensepithelial cells in vitro and in vivo .the behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos wasstudied in three different experimental situations.. (a) explantationinto several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed byreimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantationfollowed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity .specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lensmaterial of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serialsections . the results were interpreted as follows..1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium,embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount ofindependent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they failto undergo any fiber formation .2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explantswill respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellulardifferentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changesnecessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support theseresponses .3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficientfor their complete autonomous maturation .4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the onlydeterminant of its overall shape .

experiments dealing with the role played by the aqueous humor and retinain lens regeneration of adult newts .1. these three groups of experiments involve approximately 140 eyes ofadult newts, triturus v. viridescens . they were devised to examinewhat, if any, role the aqueous humor plays during lens regeneration fromthe dorsal iris .2. many daily injections of aqueous humor from normal eyes were madein lentectomized eyes for as long as 96 days in some cases . as controlssome lensless eyes were daily injected with holtfreter's solution . inothers aqueous humor was merely withdrawn .3) procedures for the injection experiments are difficult to control .however, the most successful cases showed varying degrees of inhibitionand retardation of lens regeneration .4. pairs of eyes were united at large adjacent wound openings toprovide a common reservoir of aqueous humor bathing both lenses anddorsal irises . in some cases the eyes were placed on the side of thebody . in others more successful unions were made by fusing atransplanted eye to the right eye of a host .5. approximately three months after operation one of two large lensregenerates in a pair of perfectly fused eyes was removed . six weekslater a new large lens regenerate reappeared in most of thelentectomized units in the presence of the intact lens of the other unit6. there is a strong possibility that the more than normal amount ofneural retina present provided a more powerful retinal factor for lensregeneration than the inhibiting influence of the intact lens in theenvironment .

1463. investigations of lens protein and microelectrophoresis ofhydrosoluble protein in senile cataractthe investigations on lens protein andon agar-microelectrophoresis of hydro-soluble protein in normal lenses and in those affected with senile cataract re-vealed the following facts  (1) in opaquelenses, a diminution of the total proteinand the soluble protein takes place, aswell as an increase in the amount of in-soluble protein.  the decrease in thequantity of soluble protein is higher than theincrease of insoluble protein which doesnot only point to a transformation of thesoluble protein into the insoluble variety,but also to the disappearance of a proteinfraction from the lens.  changes in thequantity of soluble protein are accompaniedby the decrease of protein in slow fractionsof the electropherogram and even bythe disappearance of these fractions andthe increase of the amount of protein infractions of medium velocity.  with thedevelopment of cataract and the maturephase of cataract, all these processesbecome more and more distinct.  in thisrespect, a strong parallelism exists betweenthe protein changes and the clinicalpicture of senile cataract.  (2) qualitativeand quantitative changes which occur inthe protein of normal lenses with advancingage show a character similar to thosein senile cataract, however, they are lesspronounced.  in this instance, the de-crease in the quantity of soluble protein islikewise closely associated with thediminution of the protein content in the slowfractions of the electropherogram.(3) the changes in the soluble protein contentof the lens and the alterations ofthe protein amounts in the slow fractions whichalways accompany the former,play the principal role in the aging processof the lens and in the development ofsenile cataract.  (4) the investigationsseem to indicate that the aging processes,of lenses as well as the development ofsenile cataract are of a similar character,but of different intensity.  (5) undoubtedly,the processes of transition from slowfractions of soluble protein into faster onesand the transformation of part of thesoluble protein into insoluble protein which islikely to be associated with theseprocesses as well as the partial disappearanceof total protein from the lens seemto play a very important part in the mechanismspertaining to the developmentof cataract.

787. further autoradiographic studies of the lens epithelium.normal and x-irradiated rat eyescell proliferation and migration inthe lens epithelium of normal and x-irradiatedrat eyes were studied by means ofautoradiography after labelling with tritiatedthymidine.  cells of the normal lensepithelium require 16 hr. to pass from thebeginning of the synthesizing periodto the completion of mitosis.  this interval ispartitioned as follows  s period,approximately 10 hr.; g2, slightly less than 5 hr;and mitosis, 72 min.  following division,labelled daughter cells migrate from thegerminative zone to the postequatorialrows, and by 2 weeks after tracer injectionmany radioactive nuclei are found in thelens bow.  epithelial cells irradiated whilein the dna synthesis phase undergodegeneration beginning approximately 8 hr.after exposure.  the onset of cell deathcorresponds to the time at which these cellswould normally be preparing for mitosisindicating that they die in abortive divisions.a small percentage of the originallylabelled cells survived until 3 days after irradi-ation, but by 2 weeks this number fellalmost to zero.  the loss of radioactive cellsoccurred most rapidly in the equatorial zone.

the effects of electrophoretically separated lens proteins on lensregeneration in diemyctylus viridescens .in the present study, lenses were removed from the eyes of adultanesthetized newts, macerated in 0.03 m borate buffer at ph 8.6, andseparated by starch gel electrophoresis . upon staining with amido black10-b, seven distinct staining areas appeared in the blocks . three bandsmoved toward the anode, and three toward the cathode . in addition, aseventh moiety represented by a smear of material moved toward the anodeone millimeter times five tenths millimeter plugs were removed fromeach of these areas and were placed into freshly lentectomized eyes .plugs from most strongly positive and most weakly negative proteinsinhibited lens regeneration . in addition, plugs from the areacontaining the weakly negative protein induced either lenses withaberrant polarity or double centered lenses with centers of opposedpolarity . all other protein bands had no significant effect onregeneration .in addition to the above experiments, homogenates andproteinasedigested homogenates of lenses were injected into eyesfollowing lentectomy . three 5-ul samples were injected in each caseover a six day period . injection of the plain homogenate stimulatedlens regeneration markedly, while the proteinase destroyed thestimulatory activity .theoretical considerations of the above data are discussed .

195. properties of a cold-precipitable protein fraction in thelensa soluble protein fraction which precipitatesin aqueous solutions at temperaturesbelow 10  c has been isolated from the ratlens.  this fraction appears to be re-sponsible for the reversible 'cold cataract'which has been seen to develop whenyoung mammals are exposed to temperaturesbelow 10  c.  as the rat ages, theconcentration of this protein fractiondecreases, but the fraction does not com-pletely disappear, even from the lensesof 3-year-old rats.  although the molecularspecies comprising this fraction appear tobe homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge,disc electrophoresis and immunodiffusionhave shown that they are a heterogeneousmixture of a-, b- and y-crystallin subunits.the ability of the cold-precipitableprotein (ccp) fraction to precipitate in thecold depends upon its concentration andthe ionic strength and ph of the solvent.  insolutions of ph 4.0, some aggregationof the 4 s cpp occurs to form a 17 s component,which no longer precipitates inthe cold.  the ability of this protein fraction toprecipitate in the cold may dependon hydrophobic bonding and its influence on theconformation of the protein.

correlation between the mast cells and histamine content of the eye incattle .the authors have examined the mast cell content of the eyes of cattleand have established that most of the mast cells are contained in theconjunctiva, the optic nerve and the ocular muscles,. fewer occur in thesclera and iris, and least in the ciliary body and choroid . cornea,lens and retina do not contain mast cells . the histamine content of theocular tissues and their mast cell contents generally run parallel .however, the cornea is exceptional in that its histamine does not occurin a bound state but in some form which is readily available to a mildprocess of extraction (tyrode solution at 4 c) .
