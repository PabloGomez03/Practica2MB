localization of phosphaturic effect ofparathyroid hormone in nephron of the dogthe renal mechanism and tubular site of the phosphaturic action ofparathyroid hormone were investigated by clearance and stop-flowtechniques in one intact and seven thyroparathyroidectomizeddogs.  administration of hormone caused a significant increasein the excretion of phosphate without increasing the filteredload.  stop-flow analysis indicated that in the absence of parathyroidhormone most of the filtered phosphate was reabsorbedin the proximal tubule, and that the hormone increased therate of phosphate excretion by inhibiting this reabsorptivemechanism.  p32 injected during stopped flow showed no significanttransport across the renal tubule despite the presence ofexcess parathyroid hormone.  significant p32 activity appearedin the stop-flow collections simultaneously with the appearanceof new filtrate.  there was no evidence that parathyroid hormonemediated a secretory process for phosphate excretion.

study of phosphate excretion by the stop-flowtechniquem. de myttenaerethe stop-flow technique has been applied to the dog in an attempt torule out tubular secretion of phosphate and to locate the site of action ofparathyroid hormone (p.t.h.) on the renal tubule.  under the experimentalconditions used, no significant inward transtubular movement of p32 could bedemonstrated, ruling out tubular secretion of phosphate.  stop-flowexperiments performed in parathyroidectomized dogs before and after p.t.h.administration demonstrated inhibition of phosphorus reabsorption by thehormone.  in addition, the stop-flow pattern indicated that thisphenomenon took place mainly in the distal part of the proximal tubules.

sudden hypocalcemia in normal and hypoparathyroid subjects.serum calcium concentration was suddenly decreasedin 10 normal and 4 hypoparathyroid subjectsby the infusion of 50 mg/kg of disodium edta over a30- to 45-minute interval.  the return rate to pre-infusionvalues of the serum calcium concentration was thesame in both groups.  serum phosphate showed a marked,transient decrease 30 min after the infusion in normalindividuals, but not in those with hypoparathyroidism.the hypophosphatemia was followed by a markedincrease in phosphate clearance in the normal group anda decrease in the hypoparathyroid group.  urine phosphate:urine creatinine x 10 (up:uc x 10) and urinephosphate: urine osmolality x 10 (up:uo x 10) ratiosalso reflected an increased phosphate excretion in the2 groups.  a simple clinical measure of parathyroidfunction is suggested by determining the up:uo x 10or the up:uc x 10, or both, ratios before and 3 to 6hr after intravenous infusion of disodium edta.

aspects of circadian periodic changes inphosphorus metabolism in micekinetic studies on the p32 content ofmouse brain phosphorus fractions followingthe intraperitoneal injection of p32-labeledorthophosphate were performed duringtwo selected segments of the 24-hour time scale.the results of these studies suggestthat the circadian periodicity in relativespecific activity of brain phospholipidsis probably a consequence of a variation in the extentof p32 incorporation into braininorganic phosphate and is not indicativeof a periodicity in the rate of intermediaryphospholipid metabolism.  data on the postinjectiontime course of the specific activitiesof plasma inorganic phosphate, liver inorganic phosphate,and liver phospholipidsuggest a similar explanation forthe circadian periodic changes in relativespecific activity of liver phospholipids.a circadian rhythm of inorganic phosphateconcentration in mouse plasma is demonstrated.consideration of a mathematicalmodel suggests that the observed within-dayvariation in p32 distribution and thecircadian periodicity of phospholipid relativespecific activity in liver and brainare a consequence of this periodicity inplasma phosphate content.  a significantwithin-day variation in total phosphoruscontent of liver was observed.  the disturbanceof mice incident to p32 injectionhas a marked effect on the plasma contentof inorganic phosphate and corticosterone.

parathyroid function in chronic renal failure.  a statistical surveyof the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy.a collection has been made of 134 personal andpublished cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in whichadequate information was available concerning thepathological state of the bones.  measurements wereavailable of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, andblood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonateand plasma proteins in a representative sample.the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the wholeseries of 134 cases were not related reciprocally butwere correlated directly.  these data were further analyzedby allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups,according to the type of pathological lesions present inthe bones.  in one group there was evidence of defectivemineralization of skeletal tissues, in the form of eitherrickets or osteomalacia, and the plasma-calcium wasfound to be statistically sub-normal.  in the other groupthere was no primary defect of mineralization but thelesions of generalized osteitis fibrosa were present andthe plasma calcium was statistically normal.  there wasno significant correlation between the plasma levels ofcalcium and phosphate in either sub-group; and the plasmaphosphate was significantly higher in the group withthe higher plasma calcium levels.  the data indicate thatin patients with renal osteodystrophy, contrary to generalbelief, the plasma calcium varies independently of theplasma phosphate.  since these results imply differencesin parathyroid function among patients with azotemicosteodystrophy, a survey has also been made ofthe recorded parathyroid weights in chronic renal failure.generalized osteitis fibrosa and the accompanying normallevels of plasma calcium are associated with greaterparathyroid hypertrophy than is found in most casesof chronic renal failure or cases with defective mineralization.the various data are interpreted in relationto the known metabolic disturbances and natural historyof azotemic osteodystrophy.  by analogy with states ofsimple vitamin d deficiency, it is suggested that hypocalcemiaand relative unresponsiveness to the calcemicaction of parathyroid hormone are related to an acquiredresistance to vitamin d.  the group of cases with statisticallynormal plasma-calcium prove that the parathyroidglands can function effectively in some patientswith chronic renal failure, irrespective of the level ofthe plasma phosphate.  the size of the glands and theeffects of sub-total parathyroidectomy in patients of thisgroup suggest that the normal plasma calcium resultsfrom an increased production of parathyroid hormone.the more advanced renal failure in the normocalcemic,as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could meanthat the development of an effective degree of secondaryhyperparathyroidism is a function of the duration of therenal disease.  it seems likely that when the parathyroidresponse is sufficient to overcome the effects of the vitamind resistance it also entails the development of generalizedosteitis fibrosa, healing of the defect of mineralizationand increased liability to metastatic calcification.

the role of aldosterone and vasopressin in the posturalchanges in renal excretion in normal subjectsand patients with idiopathic edemathe effects of the upright posture(leisurely walking for 2 hours) on half-hourly urine volume, and excretion ofsodium and creatinine were studied in13 normal subjects and 13 patients withidiopathic edema, while they drank 150or 300 ml. of 0.14 per cent sodiumchloride solution every half hour.  whenthe 2 hours of walking were comparedwith a preceding recumbent period of4 hours, both groups were found to showa significant antidiuresis upright.  theadministration of ethanol during the lasthalf hour of recumbency abolished thefall in urine flow and in free water clear-ance during the first hour of walking inthe normal subjects and significantly re-duced this fall in the patients withedema.  sodium excretion in the normalsubjects was slightly but not significantlylower when upright than when recum-bent, but in the edematous patients wassignificantly lower when upright and fellprogressively over the 2 hour period.  ad-ministration of spironolactone or d-amphetamine increased sodium excretionduring recumbency in both groups butincreased sodium excretion upright onlyin the edematous patients to equal thatof the normal subjects.  creatinine excre-tion was not changed in either group byposture or drug therapy.  similar studieswere performed on 5 patients with un-treated diabetes insipidus and on 6 pa-tients with adrenal insufficiency treatedwith hydrocortisone alone.  lack of al-dosterone (in adrenal insufficiency) didnot increase the amount of sodium ex-creted above that of normal subjects inrecumbency and did not prevent the oc-currence of significant sodium retentionin the upright posture.  however, lackof adh (in diabetes insipidus) delayedthe antidiuresis upright for 30 minutes.the results indicate that adh releaseis probably responsible for the reductionin urine volume during the first 30 min-utes after assuming the upright posture,but not thereafter.  the excessive magni-tude of the orthostatic antidiuresis inidiopathic edema probably results froma cause other than adh release, since itis not completely overcome by ethanol.reduced na excretion during 2 hours inthe upright posture can occur in theabsence of circulating aldosterone, butthe abnormal magnitude of the na re-tention in the patients with idiopathicedema probably results from hyperal-dosteronism.

metabolism and excretion of bilirubin c in experimental obstructivejaundice.bile duct ligation was carried out in a series ofrhesus monkeys.  the time required for the serum bilirubinto stop rising and achieve a relatively stable level,and the average serum bilirubin reached, paralleled closelythat seen clinically.  after the serum bilirubin levelshad stopped rising and a 'steady state' had been reached,radioactive bilirubin was injected i.v.  the radioisotope wasdistributed principally extravascularly and not in the sameratio as albumin, as in other forms of jaundice.  daily turnoverof bilirubin was found to be double that anticipatedfrom normal hb breakdown, suggesting increased bilirubinproduction in obstructive jaundice.  in animals followed for2 wk nearly 80% of injected radioactivity was excreted in theurine, indicating that in obstructive jaundice the kidneytakes over entirely from the liver the function of bilirubinexcretion.

bone growth and metabolic studies of prematureinfants treated with human growth hormonethe influence of exogenous humangrowth hormone on growth and metabo-lism of premature infants was observed.it was not possible to register any in-crease of linear bone growth after hormoneadministration; concomitantly urinary hy-droxyproline excretion did not changesignificantly.nitrogen balance studies indicated asharp increase of nitrogen retention, due toa reduced urinary excretion, in all infants.calcium and phosphorus balances rose inthree out of four premature infants treatedwith growth hormone, but the characteris-tic sth calciuric action of sth was notobserved.  furthermore, sth failed to in-duce any significant increase in nefaserum concentration of premature infants.it may therefore be concluded that themetabolic response of premature infants tosth differs consistently from that normallyobserved in more mature subjects.

red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency--a newlyrecognized cause of neonatal jaundice and kernicterus in canadaseven male newborns of chinese, greek anditalian origin presented with severe hemo-lytic jaundice due to red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6-pd) defi-ciency.  in five, the hemolysis was precipi-tated by inhalation of mothball vapours inthe home.  kernicterus was evident uponadmission in six infants and was fatal infour of these.g-6-pd deficiency should be suspected asa cause of jaundice in all full-term maleinfants of these ethnic groups.  the diag-nosis can be confirmed in any hospital bythe methemoglobin reduction test.  in areassimilar to toronto, canada, where thesehigh-risk ethnic groups prevail, the follow-ing measures are recommended: (1) detec-tion of g-6-pd deficient newborns byscreening cord bloods of all infants of theseethnic groups: (2) protection of affectedinfants from potentially hemolytic agentssuch as naphthalene, certain vitamin kpreparations, and sulfonamides; and (3) ob-servation of serum bilirubin levels to assessthe need for exchange transfusion for hyper-bilirubinemia.

effects of short term administration ofhysiological doses of human growth hormonein three patients with turner's syndromeh. e. sjobergthe effect of apparently physiological doses of human growth hormonewas investigated in three patients with turner's syndrome in short termmetabolic balance studies.  the subjects presented an abnormal sex chro-mosome constitution and an increased level of sulphation factor activityin serum.two dose levels of hormone were used, and there appeared an anabolicresponse to both.  no correlation with dose was obtained for any of theparameters used except for urinary magnesium, where the retention wasgreater with the higher dose.  the sulphation factor activity of serum in-creased during hormone administration in the one case studied in thisrespect.the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was within the normal range inthe two patients studied in this respect, and was not altered by growthhormone.all patients had an increased urinary excretion of creatine which atpresent cannot be explained.  the creatinuria diminished during growthhormone treatment.the mechanism behind the retarded growth is discussed.  it is suggestedthat a major factor might be a defect in the center for linear growth,i.e. the epiphyses that would make these less responsive to all the factorsnormally stimulating the growth processes in the epiphyseal zones.

influence of parathyroid activity on ionexchange in various tissues1. balance data from three patients with hypoparathyroidism, who weregiven parathyroid extract, are presented.  the metabolic response wascomplex.  the data demonstrate losses of phosphate, magnesium, sodiumand potassium which were not accounted for by destruction of either boneor non-osseous tissues.  preferential depletion of these minerals from bone,or loss from non-osseous tissues, must be presumed.2. the exchange of ca45, mg28, and p32 in a spectrum of rat tissues hasbeen studied in sham operated, parathyroidectomized, and parathyroidextract treated rats.  the effects of parathyroidectomy on the developmentof magnesium deficiency were determined.3. four hours after parathyroidectomy, increased transport of calciuminto bone, kidney, intestine, liver, brain, and muscle was found.  six daysafter parathyroidectomy equilibrium had been reestablished and exchangerates were identical to those in sham operated animals.4. the administration of parathyroid extract was associated with de-creased transport of ca15, mg28, and p32 into bone.  ca15 exchange in kidneywas reduced but in all other tissues exchange of ca15 and mg28 was in-creased.  p32 exchange in both intestine and kidney was mardedly increasedin animals receiving the extract.5. parathyroidectomy greatly minimized the manifestations of mag-nesium deficiency in young rats on magnesium deficient diets.6. the results suggest that parathyroid hormone may affect the trans-port and exchange of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate (and perhapssodium and potassium) in tissues other than those usually considered tobe target organs.

3716. glycolytic control mechanisms. i. inhibition of glycolysisby acetate and pyruvate in the isolated, perfused rat heartacetate or pyruvate had similar effectson the over-all metabolism of glucose.  gly-colytic flux was decreased in both thepresence and absence of insulin, glucoseoxidation was greatly decreased, andthe conversion of glucose to glycogen and lac-tate was promoted.  glucose phosphorylationwas decreased in the presence but notin the absence of insulin.  hexokinase,phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde phos-phate dehydrogenase, and pyruvic kinaseare far displaced from equilibrium, whilethe other enzymic steps of glycolysisare maintained either at equilibrium or fairlyclose to equilibrium.  in different metabolicsituations, glycolytic flux may be affec-ted by those steps which are far displacedfrom equilibrium.  increased levels ofthe hexose monophosphates, and decreasedlevels of the other glycolytic inter-mediates between fructose 1,6-diphosphateand pyruvate after the addition of 10 mmacetate indicate that glycolytic flux wasdecreased by inhibition of phosphofructo-kinase.  after the addition of 10 mm pyruvate,fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and triose-phosphate accumulated as a result of aninhibition of either glyceraldehyde phosphatedehydrogenase or phosphoglyceric kinase.acetate had little effect on the total con-tent of oxidized or reduced di- ortriphosphopyridine nucleotides, but slightly de-creased the ratio of nad to nadh2in the cytoplasm, as estimated from the ratiosof lactate to pyruvate and a-glycerophosphateto dihydroxyacetone phosphate.  pyru-vate increased the total content of nadh2and nadph2 as shown both by an increaseof fluorescence in the intact heart, and bytissue analyses, but the ratio of nad tonadii2 in the cytoplasm was greatlyincreased.  these results demonstrate com-partmentation of pyridine nucleotidesbetween cytoplasm and mitochondria in theintact cell.  after the addition of acetate,citrate was the only intermediate of thecitric acid cycle which increased greatlyin amount, while oxaloacetate levels de-creased.  after the addition of pyruvate,the levels of citrate, a-ketoglutarate, ma-late, and oxaloacetate were all greatlyelevated.  the glutamic-oxaloacetate trans-aminase reaction as measured from thetotal contents of the reactants in the tissueremained close to equilibrium.  changesin the concentrations of the adenine nu-cleotides were insufficient to account forthe inhibition of phosphofructokinase, butthe results are consistent with control at thisstep being mediated by citrate.

effects of parathyroid hormone and other proteins in vitroon mitochondrial metabolismit is apparent that in addition to parathyroid hormone, severalnon-hormonal basic proteins stimulate mitochondrial respiration, iontransport, and atpase, but inhibit the 32pi-atp exchange reaction.thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biologicalactions of parathyroid hormone as the previous reports suggested.rasmussen et al. (1964) have also isolated from parathyroidextracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrialtransport of phosphate in vitro.  they postulated that this proteinmight be yet another biologically important factor produced by para-thyroid glands.  the latter speculation may not be warranted in viewof the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria.  allof our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroidproteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically,or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone.further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determinewhether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validlyreflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is soundto use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.

drugs and neonatal jaundice .this paper is not intended as an exhaustive review of bilirubinmetabolism nor of the many factors which may result in exaggeratedphysiologic jaundice.. for such a review the interested reader isreferred to the excellent articles by zuelzer and brown . brief mentionhas been made of the mechanism by which certain drugs may contribute tothe development of hyperbilirubinemia . a few drugs, the water-solublevitamin k derivatives, sulfasoxazole (gantrisin), the salicylates, andnovobiocin have been unequivocally shown to affect adversely the newborninfant's ability to handle bilirubin . in time other compounds willdefinitely be incriminated .it is important to remember that the administration of a drug to amother just prior to delivery may result in appreciable concentrationsof the compound in the infant's serum, and that drugs administered tothe nursing mother may be excreted in breast milk and thereby absorbedby the infant . careful consideration of the drugs given not only to thenewborn but also to the mother is therefore essential if we are to avoidwhat may be termed iatrogenic hyperbilirubinemia .

the importance of steroid hormones in hyperbilirubinemia, and icterusof the newborn.administration of naturally occurring steroids(estriol, pregnanediol, cortisone)between the 7th and the 11th day of life increasesthe bilirubin level of these newborns.administration of the same steroidsor of progesterone to nursing mothersresults in hyperbilirubinemia of their infants.these facts explain the pathogenesisof neonatal jaundice.  interpretation of theexperimental and clinical findings leadsto the conclusion that the high amount ofsteroid hormones which must be excretedduring the neonatal period in conjunctionwith the relative insufficiency of the neonatalliver is responsible for the inabilityto conjugate bilirubin with glucuronic acid.the steroid hormones probably competewith bilirubin for the enzyme and substratenecessary for conjugation.  the functionalcapacity of the neonatal liver isnot high enough to conjugate both bilirubinand steroids.  only after excretion of theplacental steroids does sufficient conjugationof bilirubin become possible.  furthermore,pregnanediol appears to inhibit theenzyme glucuronyl transferase.  thesemechanisms show the importance of steroidhormones in the pathogenesis of neonataljaundice and their importance as anaggravating factor in the development ofjaundice due to erythroblastosis.  these newlydeveloped concepts may have therapeuticimplications on which the author willreport at a later date.

growth hormonegrowth hormone influences protein, fat,carbohydrate, and mineral metabolism.  itpromotes nitrogen retention, growth ofcartilage, transportation of amino acidsthrough the cell wall, and incorporation ofamino acids into protein.  this factor mo-bilizes free fatty acids from adipose tissueand increases the serum concentration ofthese substances; long-term administrationof this hormone is followed by depletion ofbody fat stores and inhibition of fatty acidsynthesis.  in diabetic subjects growth hor-mone administration is followed by hyper-glycemia, glycosuria, and ketosis; its effecton carbohydrate metabolism in normal sub-jects is more subtle.  sodium, potassium, andinorganic phosphate are retained followingthe administration of growth hormone.hypercalciuria also accompanies such treat-ment, an effect mediated through the para-thyroid glands.human growth hormone may be detectedin the serum through the use of the radio-immunoassay.  the hypothalamus is inti-mately involved with the control of thesecretion and release of growth hormonefrom the pituitary.  there is a correlationbetween the availability of glucose for me-tabolism and the plasma concentration ofgrowth hormone; when glucose is unavail-able growth hormone is released in order toprovide a substitute source of energy, fattyacids.the administration of growth hormoneto the patient with hypopituitarism is fol-lowed by growth in many instances, but ithas not usually been effective in promotinggrowth in individuals with other abnormali-ties.  acquired resistance to the effect ofgrowth hormone is accompanied by the de-velopment of antibodies directed againstthis protein.

4179. reduced estriol excretion in patientswith breast cancer prior to endocrinetherapythe urinary quotient of estriol/estrone +estradiol-17b(eq) was measured chemically inwomen with and without breast cancer, as an in-dex of the ratio of noncarcinogenic impeded es-trogens to mammary carcinogenic estrogens.  in34 controls, the median eq was 1.3 before and 1.2after menopause, with only 21% of the patients sub-normal.  in 26 breast cancer patients without endo-crine treatment or recent surgery, the median eqwas 0.5 and 0.8 respectively, with 62% of the pa-tients subnormal.  after major surgery or hormo-nal therapy, only 23% of 53 patients were subnor-mal, no remissions being observed unless the eqrose toward normal.  matching of 24 controls andpatients in pairs by age and ovarian status in thewilcoxon test indicated that the decreased eq ex-creted in untreated cancer was significant at the0.2% confidence level.  the marked increase in eqinduced by castration and androgen, estrogen, andcorticosteroid therapy suggests that normaliza-tion of a precancerous metabolic imbalance be-tween impeded and active estrogens derived fromovarian and adrenocortical sources contributed toarrested growth of estradiol-dependent metastases.

the effect of actinomycin d on parathyroid-inducedchange in bone and kidney.actinomycin d (amd), an antibiotic known toinhibit dna-directed rna synthesis,was used to study parathyroid-induced changesin ca mobilization in vivo and in vitroas well as renal excretion of ca and phosphatein rats.  intact and parathyroidectomizedrats subjected to peritoneal lavage wereadministered amd, and changes inca, p, and mg in lavage and serum wereexamined.  amd consistently lowered theca transfer into the peritoneal rinse in boththe intact and parathyroidectomized animals,although the drop in ca was more acuteif the animals were pretreated by subcutaneousinjections of amd than if amd wasadministered as a component of therinse.  pretreatment of lavaged animals withamd prevented the expected increasein osteoclast numbers in the distal metaphysisof the femur but had no effect if administeredas a component of the peritoneal rinse.the incubation of femora removedfrom both intact and parathyroidectomizedanimals resulted in media ca levels thatwere significantly lower after 4 hr. incubationwhen amd was added in vitro.  however,transfer of recently injected ca intothe incubation medium from animalstreated with amd was increased.  in addition,parathyroidectomy of animals subsequentto administration of amd still resultedin expected changes in ca and p in theurine although amd significantly increased pexcretion in both intact and parathyroidectomizedanimals.  it was concluded thatendogenous parathyroid hormone requiresthe continuous production of enzymes ultimatelyresponsible for its action on boneand kidney, but that this action is not necessarilyrelated directly to the productionof m-rna.

insulin and protein metabolismthe present status of protein synthesis within cells hasbeen outlined.  protein is formed in the absence of insulin;the net formation of protein is accelerated by insulin.  theeffects of insulin on protein metabolism take place independentlyof the transport of glucose or amino acids into thecell; of glycogen synthesis; and of the stimulation of highenergy phosphate formation.  in the case of protein metabolism,as in certain studies on the pathways of glucose andfat metabolism, these observations reveal striking intracellulareffects of insulin in many tissues.  within mosttissues the effect of insulin appears to find expression predominantlyat the microsomal level.  incidentally, otherhormones which affect protein metabolism such as growthor sex hormones appear to act at the microsomes.  the factthat insulin exerts effects on protein metabolism at otherintracellular sites as well as the above independent effectsleads one to agree that its action consists of a stimulationof multiple, seemingly unrelated, metabolic events.the fact that an immediate effect of insulin on proteinsynthesis is independent of the immediate need for extracellularglucose or amino acids does not mean that thesustained functioning of cells is likewise independent.  thebiochemist is fully aware of metabolic defects in diabeteswhich are not altered by insulin in vitro, but which demandvarying periods of pretreatment of the animal.  it isalso known that in diabetes some proteins (enzymes) maybe deficient while others may be produced in excess in theabsence of insulin.it is suggested that the physician desires at least twokinds of relation between these fundamental studies and hispatients.  one is the possible relation of a deficiency of insulinaction to pathological processes in tissues which havenot as yet been examined by the methods described.  theother is the need for more accurate measurements of themetabolic disorder and its control than such things asurinary and blood glucose.  in developing such future improvements,the place of insulin in protein biosynthesismust be kept in mind.

measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorptionspectrometry .an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitatesquantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, includingurine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins .the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorptionspectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit directmeasurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary toemploy a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate thenickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry .the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine andhuman b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . therecovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a rangefrom 94 to 97, and the recovery of nickel added to human b-globulinaveraged 101 per cent, with a range from 96 to 104 .the mean concentration of nickel in 24-hr. collections of urine from17 normal subjects was 1.8 ug. per 100 ml. (s.d. = 0.8), with a rangefrom 0.4 to 3.1 . the mean urinary excretion of nickel was 19.8 ug. per24 hr. (s.d. = 10.0), with a range from 7.2 to 37.6 .the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleicacids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the meanconcentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugalsupernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. ofrna, with a range from 21 to 39 .measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serumproteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and bycold-ethanol precipitation . the highest concentrations of nickel werefound in preparations of serum b-globulins .
