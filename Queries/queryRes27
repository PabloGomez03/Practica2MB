studies on loiasis in monkeys.iv.--experimental hybridization of the human andsimian strains of loain the cameroons rain-forest there exist two strains of loa, each apparentlyevolving in its own host-vector complex (duke and wijers, 1958).  the naturalsimian parasite which is found most abundantly in the drill (mandrillusleucophaeus), is characterized by the large somatic size of the adult wormsand microfilariae and by its nocturnal microfilariae periodicity.  it istransmitted among the monkey population by the crepuscular canopy-dwellingchrysops langi and c. centurionis.  the natural human parasite has diurnallyperiodic microfilariae and is transmitted by the day-biting anthropophilicc. silacea and c. dimidiata (bombe form).  it can also be transmittedexperimentally to the drill, in which host the parasites are of small somaticsize and maintain their diurnal periodicity.as the two strains of contrasting periodicity can be maintained in drills, itwas decided to try cross-mating them to produce hybrids.  the present paperdescribes the methods by which this was done, records the characteristics ofthe hybrid parasites, and suggests that, when interbreeding, the two strainssegregate according to a simple mendelian pattern as regards periodicity andsomatic size.

the filarial parasites of the eastern gorilla in the congoa survey for parasites has been undertaken in 20 mountaingorillas (gorilla gorilla beringei) from the eastern congo kivuprovince.six full-grown (two males and four females),three adolescents(one male and two females), and elevenyoung gorillas wereexamined, some of them during severalconsecutive months.  nineautopsies were performed.no protozoa were discovered in the blood.plasmodium parasiteswhich are common in gorillas and chimpanzeesfrom west africawere never found in the eastern congo primates,including tenother gorillas examined previously and some fifty chimpanzees.severe diarrhoea with a balantidiasis picture developed in twoyoung gorillas.  autopsy revealed however an intensive infectionwith oesophagostomum stephanostomum and resulting fatty degenera-tion of the liver.  oligotrichida belonging to the genus troglodytellawere commonly found in the intestinal tract.  oesophagostomumstephanostomum eggs were consistently present in the stools ofthe gorillas and autoinfection caused the death of several younggorillas 4 to 6 weeks after their capture.many microfilariae were found in the blood and the skin.  pre-liminary communications were published mentioning the existenceof four different microfilariae in the blood of gorillas and of threeothers in the dermal layers of the skin.  after a detailed study sevenspecies have been identified and described:  dipetalonema leopoldi,d. gorillae, d. vanhoofi, d. streptocercum, microfilaria binucleata,loa loa gorillae n.subsp. and onchocerca volvulus.  three of theworms described have so far been discovered only in gorilla gorilla,namely dipetalonema leopoldi, d. gorillae and loa loa gorillae.  twoof them were previously known from the chimpanzee, namelyd. vanhoofi and microfilaria binucleata.  one species, d. strepto-cercum, first discovered in man and later described from the chimpan-zee, is now also known from gorilla gorilla.  onchocerca volvulus hasbeen found in only one of the 20 gorillas examined.  gorilla gorillaberingei in eastern congo might become through close contactwith man and his filarial vectors an abnormal or accidental host ofd. streptocercum and onchocerca volvulus or else might be consideredas an original reservoir of these filarial parasites of man.

filariasis in mountain province, luzon, republic of the philippines.an endemic focus of w. bancrofti in mountainprovince, luzon (calaccad valley),is discussed.  an 11% microfilaremia ratewas found.  the parasites were probablybrought into this area in the original humanmigration, as recent immigrants camefrom non-infected areas.  no infection wasfound in children under 12 yr. of age,which correlates with spraying of the areasince 1953.  however, some people livein unsprayed houses, and children maybecome infected.  with coming road developmentand urbanization, culex p. fatiganswill move in and undoubtedly increasetransmission.  currently anopheles minimusflavirostris is the most importantlocal vector.  aedes (finlaya) niveus wasprobably also a vector.

factors influencing development of tumors in frogs .(1) study of 75 spontaneous tumors of vermont frogs showed threepathological grades of malignancy present.. aggressive renaladenocarcinoma in some 30 per cent, medium adenocarcinoma in 50 percent, and lower grade mixed with tumors of undetermined origin in theremaining 20 per cent .(2) correlation with parasite infections (trematodes) was demonstrablein only few cases in the kidney . hyperplasias and neoplasias gradinginto lung primary carcinoma have been found in the lung in r. pipiens .temperatures below 15 c. protected animals from lung as well as kidneydisease . higher temperatures disturbed the host-parasite relationshipsand led to higher incidence of malignancy . in the bullfrog, precancerwas clearly associated with the worm attachment discs .(3) other histological types of tumors in vermont frogs includedlymphosarcomas, liposarcoma, mesothelioma, epithelioma, and adrenal andcartilage tumors of uncertain malignancy .(4) improved methods of obtaining tumor filtrates allowed greaterprobability of inducing malignancy with direct renal injection . in 106frogs 37 per cent developed histologically provable cancers in theranges of three to seven months . twenty-six per cent showed somepre-cancer response and 43 per cent were negative . within the seriesreceiving filtrate from high malignancy donors one group yielded 100 percent positive, the others 50 and 38 per cent, respectively .(5) among animals injected with /low/ malignancy filtrate, fewertumors resulted . some of these were clearly vesicular carcinomas andcould be classed as lung tumors .(6) improved tissue culture methods allowed explants to live in liquidmedia under perforated cellophane up to one year . slower growth, aidedby lower temperatures (16 c.) improved the microecology of cell typesand allowed detailed daily observations of each cell's intranuclear andintranucleolar physiology for extended time-lapse cine-photography .(7) mechanisms for malignant transformation are related to increasedactivity and production of nucleolar dna and rna . the infective dnahypothesis is not classical virus theory, but it does offer detailedsupport .

some observations on the effects in vivo of varying ambient temperatureson filarial worms of snakes.new information was obtained on the biologyof filarial worms from experimentsusing constrictor constrictor mexicanusboas, infected with macdonaldius oscheiworms.  the microfilariae of m. oschei areaperiodic with respect to the light cycle,but fluctuate sharply in density from dayto day.  maximum minimum levels occurapprox. 2 days apart.  the microfilariaeare larger and more variable in size onthe days of maximum density than on thedays of minimum density.  it is suggestedthat the smaller microfilariae on the daysof low parasitemia are those that havebeen born recently and that they enlargeduring the following 48 hr. before they enterthe peripheral capillaries.  low ambienttemperatures have little effect upon m.oschei.  exposure of the host to ambient temperaturesabove 36 c for a period of24-48 hr. appears sufficient to kill adultm. oschei.  all microfilariae apparently diewithin 144 hr. at this temperature, and inslight infections.  they disappeared fromthe blood altogether within that period.  microfilariaefrom an infection 20 timesmore severe, however, were not eliminatedfrom the circulation prior to the deathof the host after 288 hr., although all thoseobserved were either decomposed ordistorted and apparently dead.  the indicationthat the temperature serves as a limitingfactor for the parasite at a point severaldegrees lower than that postulated forthe host species, is probably correlatedwith the nocturnal habits of the host.

lesions of the liver in hereditarymetabolic diseaseswhether the various cells of the liver, both parenchymal and stromal,receive genetic misinformation in all hereditary diseases caused by genemutation is unknown, but the metabolic capabilities of these several celltypes are so diverse that it is not surprising that their involvement inmany such diseases can be demonstrated by clinical, pathological, or bio-chemical methods.  repetitive abnormality of the liver has apparently notbeen defined for any disease caused by quantitative (i.e., chromosomal)gene anomaly, whether produced by nondisjunction, translocation, ormajor deletion, perhaps because relatively few such diseases have beendescribed.  as a result, the genetically determined disorders of the liversurveyed in this paper appear to be the result of conventional "singlegene" abnormalities, and to be transmitted in affected families by men-delian mechanisms.

2469. the nature of collagen disease, particularly of systemic lupuserythematosus (sle), with special reference to renal lesions (japanese)from the results of examination of 161 autopsy cases of collagen diseases,rheumatic fever and polyarteritis nodosa (pn) are considered as diseases ofhyperergic nature, showing pronounced specific manifestation in particularorgans.  as the reactivity becomes lower, this specific localization becomesless significant and many organs become affected in sle.  it may accordingly besupposed that sle is not a disease of hypersensitivity but one occurring ina state of exhaustion of reactability after prolonged sensitization.  moreover,a sle-like syndrome arises not only in the end stage of parasepsis, nephritis,nephrosis and some cases of prolonged sensitization by myco.tb but also inpn,pss,dm and rheumatism.  it may therefore be conceivable that sle isa syndrome rather than a separate entity.  it is most important to considerwhether sle-like symptomatology may be regarded as a process equal toan auto-immunization and whether the key to morphological elucidation of theauto-immune phenomenon may lie hidden in this problem.

1688. surface phenomena in lungs in health and diseasein summary, the authors have attemptedto bring together the multiple observationswhich seem germane to the understandingof surface phenomena in lungs in healthand disease.  to this end, the contributionsof anatomists and pathologists on thefine structure of alveolar cells and theirlining are fundamental.  the concepts ofalveolar stability required the specialinsights of physiologists who were concernedwith the causes of bubble stability asthey related to the particular problems posedby a lung of several millions of bubblesarranged in parallel.  soon the contributionsof the chemists became significant asmethods of identification and assay of the al-veolar lining material were of interest.clinicians asked what relevance these studieshad to atelectasis as it occurs in disease,and soon the question of when the surfac-tant appeared in development occurred tothose concerned with premature infants.students of metabolism began to focus onthe lung as a site of phospholipid synthesis,and their tools seem most promising atthis time in unearthing possible errors inmetabolism which may express themselvesin disease.  surgeons who undertake per-fusion of the isolated lung ask therequirements of that organ with respect to thenutrients and environment of the alveolarcells, and anesthesiologists inquire intothe possibilities of mechanical injuryto the alveoli during artificial respiration.the problems posed to the reviewersof a subject which touches so many disciplinesare obvious.  doubtless some pertinentstudies have been omitted although uninten-tionally; others may have beenmisinterpreted through lack of qualifications as spe-cialists in all specialties.  theauthors hope they have provided evidence that theforces of surface tension cannotbe ignored in an organ with an air-liquid interfaceof some 70 m2.  they further hopethey have described some of the properties ofthe film at the alveolar-air interfacewhich operate to produce stability of the alveoli.they hold the belief that study of themetabolism of the alveolar lining layer willfurther their understanding of a numberof disease processes in which it may bealtered.  and lastly, they hope for muchcloser communication between workers inmany disciplines who can elucidate thisremarkable subject best through cooperativestudies.

studies of the antihemophilic factor (ahf, factor viii) produced in vonwillebrand's disease.it has been confirmed that persons with autosomalahf deficiency (von willebrand'sdisease) produce large quantities ofahf when transfused with ahf-deficientplasma from persons with hemophilia a.this occurs despite the fact that'complementation' does not occur in vitro.  oneprediction from a model suggestingthat the x-locus for ahf is structural whilethe autosomal locus is regulatory isthat the ahf which appears in von willebrand'sdisease after transfusion will bestructurally normal.  the ahf obtained underthese conditions has been tested bymethods and the results fulfil the prediction.this may imply that the model iscorrect.  on the other hand, the prediction mayhave been fulfilled for otherreasons.  perhaps the wrong parameters wereexamined, or the large standarderrors of the tests masked a real difference.further tests are obviously neededbefore one can feel reasonably certain thatmutation of a regulatory gene is thebasis of von willebrand's disease.  an examinationof persons with sex-linked andautosomal ahf deficiency using an antibodyprepared against wild type ahf mightbe very illuminating.  also, transfusion studiesshould be carried out on personshomozygous for von willebrand's disease ifsuch persons can be found.  failureto obtain 'new synthesis' in a homozygote wouldthrow great doubt on a model whichimplies that the reduced ahf levels in vonwillebrand's disease heterozygotes isdue entirely to reduction in an effector substancewhich neutralizes the repressorof an x-chromosome operon directly codingthe ahf molecule.

management of advanced ovarian carcinoma.the life graph is presented for the purposeof illustrating the results of treatmentfor patients with ovarian carcinoma whoeventually died from their disease.  it includesall patients regardless of initial stageof disease, histology of the tumor, ortherapy employed.  the series is a selectedone because of the type of patient referredto the medical oncology service, andit demonstrates that almost 2/3 of the patientsdied within 2 yr. of diagnosis.  allpatients received active, aggressive anti-tumoras well as supportive therapy, althoughthere was no formal protocol for patientmanagement.  it might be possible, employinga standardized therapeutic approach-irradiationwhen indicated to the entireabdomen in the dose range of 3,500rads, followed by judicious use of currentlyavailable anticancer drugs when thedisease recurs-to produce a modest increasein the 2-year survival figures.  sincemost series show that approximately 75%of patients with ovarian carcinoma are instage iii of iv when first diagnosed, moreattention might be directed to earlierdiagnosis.  while it is an important field forinvestigation, methods of facilitatingearly diagnosis are not apparent at the moment.controlled trials of adjuvant therapyfor stage i and ii disease in which approximately40% of recurrences are seenshould be expanded.  this might consist ofinstillation of radioactive or chemicalagents into the abdominal cavity, the use ofsystemic chemotherapy during or immediatelyafter operation, or infusion of drugsinto the abdominal aorta.  for stagesiii and iv controlled trials of drugs alone,sequentially, or in combination with orsubsequent to irradiation seem indicated.finally, efforts to find more effectiveanticancer drugs must continue.

hemorrhagic episodes in hemophilia: a 5-year prospective study.medicosocial studies of hemophilia are ofparticular clinical importance in allowing an assessmentof the likely course of the disease at differentages and for differing grades of severity, and inproviding knowledge of which complications causethe most disability, loss of education, and earningcapacity.  they also overcome the distorted clinicalimpression of the disease which arises from therecurrent admission of the same few severely affectedhemophiliacs.  owing to the considerable individualvariation in the number and severity of complicationsin different hemophiliacs an accurate individualprognosis can never be given.  in general,however, the number of spontaneous episodes peryear decreases with age, while the severity of individualepisodes tends to increase, at least untilthe age of 21 yr.  there is general agreement thatthe bulk of hospital hemophilic admissions are dueto hemarthroses and that hemophilic arthropathyinvolves the knee more than it does any other joint.the increased time spent in hospital per episode inlater life is in part at least due to the developmentof relatively unstable weight-bearing joints due tohemophilic arthropathy and associated muscle atrophy.thus the correct management of individualhemarthroses in childhood is of considerable importance,and at the present time too little is knownof the best possible treatment for these episodes.little is known of the pathological mechanisms ofhemophilic arthropathy and whether it is the presenceof blood or its presence under tension whichleads to joint destruction.  thus opinions differ concerningthe routine admission of all hemarthrosesto hospital regardless of severity and also about theadvisability of joint aspiration in an attempt to avoidthe development of destructive arthropathy.  becauseof the individual variation between patients, thechanges in the pattern of the disease with age, andthe difficulty of obtaining suitable control patientsthese questions can be answered only by furtherlongterm prospective medicosocial studies.

isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from adults with respiratoryinfections.isolation of mycoplasma organisms from the sputumwas attempted in 254 patients with various syndromeof respiratory disease.  isolates were obtained in 56% ofthe 197 patients with pneumonia, 50% of patients withchronic bronchial diseases who were not treated withtetracycline, and 33% of persons with acute upper respiratoryinfection.  these differences are not statisticallysignificant and indicate a nonpathogenic role for m.pharyngis and m. salivarium which were the strains mostfrequently isolated.  the highest frequency of isolationwas from males 15 to 30 yr. of age.  isolation of m.pneumoniae requires one to 2 weeks:therefore, it is notuseful for rapid diagnosis.  also, it underestimates theprevalence of infection, especially if patients have receivedtetracycline.  of the serologic tests, complement-fixation(cf) was the most specific.  the growthinhibition test (tri) was the most sensitive and wassignificantly related to atypical pneumonia.  the 2 testsmay measure different antibodies against m. pneumoniae.serum cold agglutinins developed in many casesof pneumonia and were poorly discriminatory in etiologicdiagnosis.  m. pneumoniae infection occurred in aminimum of 8% and a maximum of 20% of civilian patientshospitalized for pneumonia during the season studied.serologic evidence for m. pneumoniae was rare inlobar pneumonia.  in nonlobar pneumonia, m. pneumoniaeaccounted etiologically for 13% to 50% of cases.  the incidenceof m. pneumoniae infection was constant indifferent seasons but greatest relative to the occurrenceof pneumonia in the fall and spring.

the prevention of cripplingin haemophilic childrenchildren who are severely affected with haemo-philia or christmas disease suffer repeatedhaemorrhages into joints and muscles after trivialinjuries.  these episodes of bleeding producecumulative crippling.  the haemarthroses tend to berecurrent; each episode produces some damage tothe joint surface and the immobility during con-valescence leads to muscle weakness.  thus afterrecovery the joint becomes increasingly liable torenewed bleeding.  the deep muscle haematomatacan produce crippling by actual destruction ofmuscle tissue, by pressure on important nerves orarteries, by contractures which develop duringhealing and by failure of resolution of the originalhaematoma leading to chronic cyst formation.

3752. steroid excretion in early breast cancerpatients with advanced breast cancerwho subsequently fail to respond to adrenalec-tomy or hypophysectomy have beenfound to excrete abnormal amounts of theurinary metabolites of androgen andcortisol.  when similar measurements arecarried out on patients with early breastcancer, it is found that approximately halfthe cases presenting for mastectomy arealso excreting abnormal amounts of thesesteroids.  subsequent follow-up shows thatthese cases tend to have a poor progno-sis, and a trial had therefore been startedin which the abnormality is being cor-rected.  in addition, it seems possible thatthe deficiency in adrogen excretion mayprecede the onset of the disease.  thisproblem is being investigated in a trialinvolving urinary steroid estimations in5000 normal women.  the measurementsare being compared with the subsequentdevelopment of breast cancer.

5319. urinary porter-silber chromogensfollowing intravenous metho-pyrapone and acth in patients with breast cancerurinary porter-silber chromogens have beenmeasured in 2 groups of patientswith breast cancer before, during and afterintravenous methopyrapone andacth administration.  the control groupconsisted of females free of disease5 years or more following mastectomy whilethe study group had documentedmetastatic disease.  no significant difference inthe urinary porter-silber chromo-gens was found between the 2 groups on any dayduring the course of the study andwere within the range of normal as measuredin this laboratory.  it is concludedthat the functional reserve capacity for bothpituitary acth secretion and adreno-cortical steroidogenesis in patients withadvanced metastatic breast cancer is rela-tively normal.

oxygen consumption of paralysed men exposed to cold .1. oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output were measured whenhuman subjects were cooled for 80-210 min . two subjects were normal,one had been almost completely paralysed below the neck bypoliomyelitis, and two were unconscious as a result of intracranialdamage and were observed with and without paralysing doses of musclerelaxants (d-tubocurarine and gallamine) .2. when normal subjects and unconscious subjects receiving no drugswere cooled, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output rose .3. when subjects paralysed by disease or drugs were cooled, oxygenconsumption and carbon dioxide output were not increased .4. these observations are consistent with the view that in man theincrease in metabolism on cooling for periods up to 31/2 hr occurssolely in skeletal muscle .

case of salpingitis due to pleuro-pneumonalikeorganismsa case of acute salpingitis following a diagnostic curettage andaspiration of the pouch of douglas is described.  this case was resistantto penicillin and streptomycin therapy.  a pure culture of pleuropneu-monia like organisms (pplo) grew from pus removed from the secon-dary pyosalpinx by aspiration.  these organisms were sensitive to tetra-cycline which cured the adnexal infection.  no pplo were found in thevaginal discharge.pplo have frequently been isolated from the vaginae of healthyand infected women.  however, only 9 cases of pelvic inflammatorydisease with a pure culture of pplo have been reported.  the possibi-lity that these growths of pplo in the internal genitalia followed theuse of antibiotic therapy is discussed.infection with pplo should be considered when pelvic inflam-matory disease proves resistant to the common antibiotics.

bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexusa rare case of bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexusin a five-and-a-half-year old hydrocephalic girl is pre-sented.the tumor encountered at autopsy was not suspectedduring life, the existing hydrocephalus being attributedto either cytomegalic inclusion disease or toxoplasmosis.after post mortem examination, it was evident thatthe hydrocephalus was due to two factors; hypersecretionfrom the tumor itself, and obstruction at the level of thesylvian aqueduct by a delicate, tense, translucent mem-brane.an interesting and uncommon additional feature ofthis case was the presence, within the choroidal papillo-ma, of well-formed haversian bone.a plea is made for regularly considering papilloma ofthe choroid plexus in the differential diagnosis of hydro-cephalus in children, for here, early diagnosis and treat-ment might conceivably result in total cure.

the development of bilateral adenomatous adrenal hyperplasiain a case of cushing's syndrome of eighteen years' duration.a case of cushing's syndrome of 18 years'duration is presented.  the diseasebegan when the patient was 8 years old andwas partially controlled by pituitaryradiation when she was 13.  however, clinicalevidence indicate low grade but continuousadrenocortical activity for the next 13years.  the probable suppressionof gh secretion by the increased steroid levelsduring her growth period providesa reasonable explanation for the dwarfism ofthe patient.  the administration of 8 mgof dexamethasone per day failed to decreaseurinary steroid excretion.  bilateralnodular hyperplasia was found at surgery.it is suggested from the evidence presentedthat this patient's disease began firstas a primary pituitary process butduring the long duration of the acth secretionit evolved into one of autonomouslyfunctioning bilateral nodular hyperplasia.

polyuria in children.twelve polyuric children have been investigated inthe present report from their etiologico-clinical aspectand they have been classified into four broad groups.  thefirst group of diabetes insipidus syndrome included 4cases - 3 of idiopathic type and one of the acquired varietydue to hand-schuller-christian-disease.  the 4 casesin the second group of nephrogenic diabetes insipidusafter further investigations were diagnosed as renalacidosis (1 case), other renal tubular syndromes withmultiple defects (2 cases), and hypokalaemic nephropathy(1 case).  the third group of polyuria due to chronic renalfailure has been exemplified by one case.  the fourthgroup of 3 cases had compulsive water drinking as theprobable etiology.  in addition to the illustrative casehistories, a practical diagnostic approach in the contextof physiopathology of normal urine excretion has been recommended.

comparative bone marrow study using two aspiration needles and twobiopsy sites .bone marrow aspiration is now widely used in the diagnosis ofhematologic diseases and many conditions not primarily affecting theblood system . a number of techniques have been devised by which asuitable specimen of marrow can be obtained with relatively littlediscomfort to the patient . the two needle sets described in this paperhave been found to be equally reliable in obtaining bone marrow formicroscopic study and diagnosis . comparative studies of bone marrowaspirated simultaneously from the iliac crest and the sternum in 26patients show no significant difference . however, there were fourinstances of dry tap at the iliac site . this fact, in addition to theobservation that less discomfort was experienced by the patient when thesternum was used, might indicate that the sternal area is a morereliable and efficient site for obtaining bone marrow .it was also observed during this study that patients experienced lessdiscomfort when the university of illinois needle was used . the majorobjection to the use of this needle is the inability to obtain a bonecore for biopsy .

the action of oral diureticsin diabetes insipiduschronic administration of chlorothiazide andother thiazide analogues in diabetes insipidusresults in a striking reduction in urinary volumewith increase in urinary osmolality.  this curiousantidiuretic action was first described bycrawford & kennedy (1959), and though it hassince been widely confirmed in both the pituitaryand nephrogenic forms of the disease, its precisemechanism remains obscure.  a number ofinvestigators have sought to explain the phenom-enon entirely on the basis of the renal actions ofthese drugs (earley & orloff 1962, goodman &carter 1962), whilst others have contended thatabatement of polyuria may be secondary to acentral effect of the thiazides in decreasing thirst(robson & lambie 1962, skadhauge 1963).over the past two years, we have conducteddetailed in-patient studies of the action ofvarious diuretic drugs of the thiazide and otherseries in a group of 7 patients with pituitarydiabetes insipidus.

neuroaxonal dystrophy in congenitalbiliary atresianeuroaxonal dystrophy has been described in 8 patients with congenitalbiliary atresia.  the characteristic changes include axonal dystrophy, a mildloss of nerve cells and a variable degree of astrocytic reaction, mainly in thegracile, cuneate and trigeminal nerve nuclei in the medulla, and rarely inother parts of the central nervous system.the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is remarkably similar to thatin patients with prolonged mucoviscidosis and in experimental vitamine-deficient rats.it is strongly suggested that the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patientswith congenital biliary atresia is a manifestation of prolonged vitamin edeficiency.the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is also similar to that seenin aging and bears resemblance to the axonal change encountered in a groupof heredo-degenerative diseases, the various forms of "hallervorden-spatzdisease".  the pathological similarity between these diverse conditionswarrants further investigation as to the possible metabolicrelationship between them.

a genetic study of neonatal obstructive jaundice58 children with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 7 with intrahepaticbiliary atresia and 50 with 'neonatal hepatitis' were analysedconcerning diagnostic criteria, natural history, familial, clinicaland pathological data.  in extrahepatic biliary atresia, there is noevidence of a familial tendency, influence of maternal age, birthorder or disturbance of foetal development.  in 'neonatal hepatitis',there were 4 consanguineous parents, suggesting a mutantautosomal gene in homozygous form.  some infants with the genotypefor 'neonatal hepatitis' may manifest a very mild or a very severeform, so, a diagnosis was not made.  an apparent excess of malesover females may be another evidence of failure of manifestation ofthe genotype.  but 'neonatal hepatitis' may be a manifestation ofmore than one disease.  in 'neonatal hepatitis' the birth weightshows a marked decrease, perhaps as a sequence of disturbed liverfunction in the foetus.

cancer chemotherapy by continuous intra-arterial infusion ofmethotrexate.continuous intra-arterial infusions of methotrexatewere used in the treatment of45 patients with malignant disease of thehead and neck, 16 patients with advancedcancer of pelvic organs, and 7 with malignantlesions of the lower limb.  in 4 patientswith epidermoid lesions of the headand neck there was complete regressionof the local tumor.  thirty-three other patientsbenefited from treatment for varyingperiods of time, but the remaining 30showed no response.  eight patients diedduring or immediately after treatment; allhad advanced cancers of the head-and-neckregion.  the mean total dose of methotrexategiven in the patients with no responsewas significantly less than in thosewith partial regression of the tumor.this suggests that the greater the total doseof methotrexate tolerated, the greaterthe chance of beneficial response.  the roleof continuous intra-arterial chemotherapyin the management of malignant diseaseis discussed.

selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially preparedantisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrinclearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecularweights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and theslope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be saidto express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfyingthe usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephroticsyndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greaterthan the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially tosteroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changesobserved on renal biopsy .2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephroticsyndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type ofproteinuria .3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for agiven pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome .4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to thetotal daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remainsfairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein beingexcreted .5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance betweenthe degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of thedisease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initialblood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type ofprotein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and hadinitially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity typeor better .7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic andhas a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy isunlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulinclearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted withany degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with thenephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise .

5407. hypoxic-hypercapnic interaction in subjects with bilateralcerebral dysfunctionto analyze cerebral influences modifyingautonomic respiratory responses, theauthors compared normals and patientswith bilateral pyramidal tract disease fortheir ventilatory response to hypoxia andhypoxia-hypercapnia.  during eucapnia,the 2 groups showed similar hypoxicresponses.  during hypercapnia, the ventilatoryresponse to hypoxia was greater in thebrain-damaged subjects.  this apparent aug-mentation, however, was due entirelyto anoxia interacting with an abnormally fa-cilitated carbon dioxide sensitivitycompared with normals, brain-damaged patientsat pao,90-100 mm hg showed an 85%greater co2 response, and at pao,50mm hgshowed a 79% greater co2 response.since cerebral dysfunction facilitated the ven-tilatory response to hypoxia-hypercapniacombined but not the response to hypoxiaalone, the results imply that the 2respiratory stimuli interact centrally rather thanperipherally.
